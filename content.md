Apple plans to update the iMac family with the M3 chip later this year, likely around the October or November timeframe, given past precedent. Gurman describes the M2 family of chips as a "stopgap" for Apple silicon and suggests Apple is waiting for the more advanced M3 chip, based on the 3nm process technology, before updating its all-in-one desktop computer.

Intel Meteor Lake: 14th-gen CPUs
late September 2023

The key takeaway here is the move to the Intel 4, which sees the company finally shift to a 7nm process. Intel 20A refers to a 5nm process, but it’s not expected until Arrow Lake in 2024.

In April 2022, AnandTech said that Meteor Lake will be the company’s first to use EUV (extreme ultraviolet lithography) in manufacturing, moving away from the current hybrid architecture.

The new integrated GPU (a successor to the current Iris Xe) will deliver nearly 2x the performance as it currently does – according to clock speeds, anyway.

Versions with 6 performance/8 efficiency and 6 performance/16 efficiency are thought to exist, with an eight performance core version believed to be in the works too.

Tentative plans call for the complex to be finished in 2025

UCSD also is the the process of building the Theater District Living and Learning Neighborhood, a complex next to the La Jolla Playhouse that will feature room for 2,000 students, starting in fall 2023.
