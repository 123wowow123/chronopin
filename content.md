Gurman describes the M2 family of chips as a "stopgap" for Apple silicon and suggests Apple is waiting for the more advanced M3 chip, based on the 3nm process technology, before updating its all-in-one desktop computer.

Intel Meteor Lake: 14th-gen CPUs
late September 2023

The key takeaway here is the move to the Intel 4, which sees the company finally shift to a 7nm process. Intel 20A refers to a 5nm process, but itâ€™s not expected until Arrow Lake in 2024.

In April 2022, AnandTech said that Meteor Lake will be the companyâ€™s first to use EUV (extreme ultraviolet lithography) in manufacturing, moving away from the current hybrid architecture.

The new integrated GPU (a successor to the current Iris Xe) will deliver nearly 2x the performance as it currently does â€“ according to clock speeds, anyway.

Versions with 6 performance/8 efficiency and 6 performance/16 efficiency are thought to exist, with an eight performance core version believed to be in the works too.

What do Chicago, Denver, and DFW all have in common? Yes, they are all major metro areas in the US, but more importantly, they're colocated with green energy sources.

As the world adopts more and more clean energy, these regions with localized energy sources will have a huge leg up on places that don't.

Best wind potential location areÂ Chicago, Albuquerque, Phoenix,Â Denver

Dallas Fort Worth has both Solar and wind potential

Representation democracy works well when voters have the correct info to make an informed decision, to their own interests. But nobody, myself included, can keep up with all the politics of ballot initiatives, so people can often vote for things that are 100% against their own interests. Can Chronopin help me with that?

For sure, can't keep up with all the information and development creates decision paralysis or wrong decisions that can lead to the detriment of self and surrounding people. I'm constantly struggling with that. Here's a neat little site that tracks my bookmarked articles and events in a chronological order that I'm starting to use to at least put some order to my information overload.
