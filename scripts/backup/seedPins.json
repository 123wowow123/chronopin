    "title": "Xbox One Kinect stand-alone to hit the market",
    "description": "Ever since Microsoft decoupled the Kinect sensor from the Xbox One, the one lingering question was when would they sell it as a stand-alone unit? Offering an Xbox One without the Kinect sensor made financial sense in Microsoft's struggle against Sony, but it does not mean that people may never want to want to buy the Kinect at a later point. Until now though, there was no option to do so. Windows Phone Central has now learned that Microsoft is planning to sell the stand-alone Kinect sensor for $149 beginning on or around October 6. The timing is ideal as it leads well into the holiday season in the US and other countries, making the add-on an excellent gift for those who already own an Xbox One without the next-gen accessory.",

The DT-903 is unique enough to be called 'smart' and there's a good reason for the designation. We went hands on with the new DT-903 to show you what it is all about in our latest video. Featuring Qi wireless charging, NFC for 'tap-to-pair' and Bluetooth 4.0, the new Microsoft charger not only gives your Lumia power, but it tells you when you need to charge, or even if you have a missed call or text message.",

And unlike the Twizy, GEM, or a golf cart, it's fully enclosed, which means it's vastly more attractive to people living in places where it rains or snows. It uses a 4kW (5.3hp) electric motor powered by a 6kWh lithium-ion battery, which gives the Zero a range of 55 miles (89km), with a recharging time of 4.5 hours at 110V. A version with a bigger battery, the Zero+, will have a range of 85 miles (137km) thanks to a larger 8.3kWh pack‚Äîthough this increases charging time to a still-reasonable six hours.",

It‚Äôs not exactly cheap, but for $549.99 you get a high-end headset with a 4K, HDR-enabled OLED screen, a 110-degree field of view, built-in tracking cameras, and eye tracking, plus two of its slick Sense controllers with the excellent adaptive triggers and haptic feedback Sony introduced with the PlayStation 5‚Äôs DualSense controller. The catch is that it requires you to be connected to a PS5 by a single USB-C cable, but that means it‚Äôs much, much more powerful when it comes to delivering fantastic graphics than a self-contained headset like the Meta Quest 2. With all of that, including a few features you don‚Äôt see on even more expensive PC VR headsets like Valve‚Äôs Index and HP‚Äôs Reverb G2, the PlayStation VR2 has vaulted console VR into the lead in just about every category‚Ä¶ except available games.",

Street Fighter 5 was heavily criticized at launch for its lack of playable content outside of versus mode and while this satisfied most high-level players, casual players found there was very little to keep them entertained.\nCapcom has taken its time developing Street Fighter 6 to ensure they don‚Äôt repeat the same mistakes again. It features a brand new single-player story mode which gives players a chance to explore Metro City as a custom fighter. Street Fighter 6 is shaping up to become one of the best fighting games and potentially one of the best PC games overall.",
