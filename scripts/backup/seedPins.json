    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> With a picturesque waterfront already in place, San Diego will soon have its very own open-air fish market reminiscent of other similar markets around the U.S., including Seattle‚Äôs Pike Place Market. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The plan, spearheaded by County Supervisor Greg Cox, was announced Wednesday. Cox said the Dockside Fish Market at the Downtown Waterfront will set up shop at the Fish Harbor Pier, near Tuna Harbor between the USS Midway Museum and Seaport Village. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> There, the pier will transform into an open-air fish market featuring pop-up canopies, tables and lots of fresh, local catches for sale. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The market will open to the public for the first time on Aug. 2, from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. After that, it will be held at that location every Saturday morning for the next year or so. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> For now, the plan is for fishing boats to pull into the harbor and unload their catches onto the pier, which could include fish, lobster, urchins, crab and whatever else they‚Äôve caught in local waters. The fishermen will have to pay a vendor fee to be able to sell their goods at the market, but that dollar amount has not been set just yet. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Cox said the new seaside marketplace will not only give consumers a great deal on fresh fish, it will also bring business to local fishermen. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> There are still a number of commercial fisherman that are out there, they're working really hard, they're bringing their catch in on a daily basis, they're turning it over to fish markets at a wholesale price,\" said Cox. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> \"This will give them an opportunity to certainly get a higher price than they would at a wholesale fish market. But at the same time, it's going to be a great bargain for the citizens of San Diego. They will know that it's the freshest fish they can possibly get,\" he continued. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Zachary Roach is a partner for the open-air market and says his father, a commercial fisherman, has been catching rock crab for 20 years, yet the wholesale price hasn't changed. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> \"It hasn't fluctuated in giving him more money for the 20 years. But now we can, rather than sell wholesale, we can sell it here for a chunk of money and still be selling it for cheaper than what they would at retail or at a grocery store, so the consumer is getting the better rate too,‚Äù said Roach. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Employees of a nearby seafood market told NBC 7 they support the new open-air concept and hope the fishermen do well. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> As for locals and tourists, many say they‚Äôre looking forward to buying fresh seafood on the harbor. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> ‚ÄúI would totally support it ‚Äì I think that‚Äôd be great to support local fishermen,‚Äù said San Diegan Brandi Skinner. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Gloria Simon, a tourist visiting from Utah, said she‚Äôd certainly check out the marketplace. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs a great idea because I love the Seattle Pike‚Äôs Market,‚Äù she told NBC 7. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Little Italy resident Sarah Johnson said the fish market will likely become one of her go-to shopping spots for seafood.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs convenient just to walk down here and get the fresh fish right off the market and bring it home. I would be a No.1 supporter of that, definitely,‚Äù said Johnson.A proposal to promote the market will be heard for the Board of Supervisors at a July 29 meeting. Meanwhile, Cox will continue to show his support for the open-air fish market in America‚Äôs Finest City. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> \"Seattle is famous for its Pike Place Fish Market,\" said Cox. \"There's no reason San Diego, with its vibrant waterfront, busy fishing fleets and great year-round weather, can't have our own open air fish market.\" </p>",

Offering an Xbox One without the Kinect sensor made financial sense in Microsoft's struggle against Sony, but it does not mean that people may never want to want to buy the Kinect at a later point. Until now though, there was no option to do so. Windows Phone Central has now learned that Microsoft is planning to sell the stand-alone Kinect sensor for $149 beginning on or around October 6. The timing is ideal as it leads well into the holiday season in the US and other countries, making the add-on an excellent gift for those who already own an Xbox One without the next-gen accessory.",

After Skyward Sword offered a slightly more linear, story-driven campaign than most fans were used to, Breath of the Wild readjusted dramatically in the opposite direction. Suddenly you could go anywhere and climb anything in any order you wanted, and goodness gracious was there a whole lot to choose from. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> There are plenty of fair criticisms to throw at Breath of the Wild, with common ones being its lack of traditional Zelda dungeons and items. But what‚Äôs truly impressive is how much it maintained the heart of a Zelda game even as it altered nearly every system around it. To a certain extent, Zelda has always been about exploration and choice, and Breath of the Wild simply leaned into and enabled those aspects of itself above all else, now making the world a place that would react to those choices as well. There‚Äôs just so much to see, so many people to meet and secrets to find hidden throughout this long-since devastated version of Hyrule. </p>",

With the Surface family, the Xbox, and peripherals, the company doesn‚Äôt shy away from building its own products and has established a sizeable fanbase who is interested in ‚Äòwhat‚Äôs next‚Äô for the company when it relates to these types of products. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> This past week, I was tipped off that the next generation Xbox was codenamed Scarlett and in an effort to track down if this information was accurate, I was able to view content that highlighted several unannounced Microsoft products that are coming in the next two years. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Microsoft is planning for the next Xbox console release to arrive in 2020. But what is more interesting, is that Microsoft describes ‚ÄòScarlett‚Äô as a family of devices; meaning we may see multiple pieces of hardware released that year. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> That date may seem relatively close considering that the Xbox One X launched last year but Microsoft is aggressively moving ahead with hardware in the console space to shake up the industry. But what we don‚Äôt know is if this is a brand new set of devices or simply a more ‚Äòpowerful‚Äô Xbox One that is again, fully backward compatible with all the content available today. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Considering how much effort Microsoft has put into backward compatibility, I would expect the Scarlett devices to support current gen games but offer more advanced features and align possibly with Microsoft‚Äôs upcoming game-streaming services. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> As with any leak this far out, timing and plans can change but I was able to verify the information I viewed as being authentic and fully believe that the company is on-track to release the new console in two years. </p>",

Apple saw a surge of orders for older MacBook Pros instead of the new model, and that, combined with the reaction to the LG 5K display and the \"constant negativity\" from professional users, led Apple to \"double down on professional users.\"   </p><p class=\"paragraph\">   The decision to move ahead with a modular Mac Pro replacement was made \"in recent months\" with development starting \"only a few weeks ago,\" suggesting it's going to be a long wait.   </p><p class=\"paragraph\">   Given a rough estimate of the length of time it normally takes to develop a project, it could be late 2018 or even 2019 before we see the machine.   </p><p class=\"paragraph\">   The decision to go ahead and develop a modular Mac Pro replacement seems to have been made only in recent months, with development starting only a few weeks ago, which makes it clear why Apple said it won't ship this year.

The 3,280-feet (1 kilometer) skyscraper is scheduled for&nbsp;<a href=\"http://kingdomtowerskyscraper.com/september-2015-update/\" target=\"_blank\">completion in 2020</a>. The Burj Khalifa, by comparison, stands at a meeker 2,716 feet, or 827 meters. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> ‚ÄúWith this deal, we will reach new, as yet unheard of highs in real estate development, and will fulfill the company‚Äôs objective of creating a world-class urban center that offers an advanced lifestyle, so that Jeddah may have a new iconic landmark that attracts people from all walks of society with comprehensive services and a multitude of uses,‚Äù said Mounib Hammoud, Chief Executive Officer of Jeddah Economic Company. </p><h2>An architectural feat</h2><p class=\"paragraph\"> Previously dubbed Kingdom Tower, the building will boast 200 floors and overlook the Red Sea. Constructing it will require about 5.7 million square feet of concrete and 80,000 tons of steel,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentid=20140218196138\" target=\"_blank\">according to the Saudi Gazette</a>. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Building a structure that tall, particularly on the coast, where saltwater could potentially damage it, is no easy feat. The foundations, which will be 200 feet (60 meters) deep, need to be able to withstand the saltwater of the nearby ocean. As a result, Advanced Construction Technology Services will test the strength of different concretes. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Wind load is another issue for buildings of this magnitude. To counter this challenge, the tower will change shape regularly. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> ‚ÄúBecause it changes shape every few floors, the wind loads go round the building and won‚Äôt be as extreme as on a really solid block,‚Äù Gordon Gill explained to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.constructionweekonline.com/article-13533-tall-order/1\" target=\"_blank\">Construction Weekly</a>. Gill is a partner at<a href=\"http://smithgill.com/\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture</a>, the design architects for the project. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Delivering the concrete to higher floors will also be a challenge. Possibly, engineers could use similar methods to those employed when building the Burj Khalifa; 6 million cubic feet of concrete was pushed through a single pump, usually at night when temperatures were low enough to ensure that it would set. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Though ambitious, building the Kingdom Tower should be feasible, according to Sang Dae Kim, the director of the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ctbuh.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Council on Tall Buildings</a>. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> ‚ÄúAt this point in time we can build a tower that is one kilometer, maybe two kilometers. Any higher than that and we will have to do a lot of homework,‚Äù he told Construction Weekly. </p>",

The fund, to be established and managed by the City of Waukee, will support the development of community projects like parks, libraries and recreational spaces, as well as infrastructure needs. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> \"We're honored Apple is choosing Iowa for the site of its most technologically advanced data center to date,\" said Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds. \"Apple's commitment to innovation and renewable energy leadership mirrors our own. This investment in our state is vital as we continue to develop as a technology hub and grow our workforce.\" </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> As part of its pledge to power all of its global operations with 100 percent renewable energy, Apple said the data center will run entirely on renewable energy from day one. Apple noted it will be working with local partners to invest in renewable energy projects from wind and other sources to power the facility. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Apple said construction on the data center is expected to start early next year, with plans to bring it online in 2020. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Iowa's Economic Development Authority reportedly&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/08/23/apple-new-data-center-iowa/\">approved a deal</a>&nbsp;on Thursday that will give Apple $208 million in state and local tax breaks to construct two data centers near Des Moines. Apple will reportedly buy 2,000 acres of land for the project, allowing for future development in the area. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Apple's plans to open the facility were&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/08/23/apple-new-data-center-iowa/\">first reported</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;The Des Moines Register&nbsp;on Wednesday. Apple CEO Tim Cook&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/08/24/tim-cook-cts-in-cincinnati/\">is in Des Moines today</a>&nbsp;for a meeting related to the data center, Iowa state officials confirmed. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Apple already operates several data centers around the world. In the United States, it has facilities located in Reno, Nevada; Prineville, Oregon; Maiden, North Carolina; Newark, California; and Mesa, Arizona. </p>",

    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\">  As the second largest city in the Jiangsu province, Suzhou is an important economic hub in East China. Reshaping its skyline is the Suzhou Zhongnan Tower, a 103-story tower with office, residences and a hotel. The tower has five stories below grade and an eight-story, long-span podium with ballroom and conference facilities. The top of the tower features a two-story observation deck.  </p><p class=\"paragraph\">  Our team completed the structural design of the original 729-meter-tall Zhongnan Tower in 2014, and the construction stopped after the concrete piles were finished. The tower design was revised in 2019 with the height reduced to 499 meters.  </p><p class=\"paragraph\">  We are providing structural design services to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gensler.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Gensler</a>&nbsp;for the new tower and previously had for the original one.  </p><h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4><ul><li>The pile foundation built for the original tower is fully utilized by the new one.</li><li>The structural system for the new tower includes a concrete core, a mega frame composed of SRC mega columns and belt trusses and outrigger trusses linking the core and mega columns.</li><li>A hollow core with the cross-web walls removed realizes the architect‚Äôs vision of providing seven large atriums. Thickened solid slabs, working as rigid diaphragms, are provided at refuge levels to ensure the stability of the core.</li><li>A key design challenge originated from the substantial gravity and lateral loads‚Äîincluding wind and seismic‚Äîinherent in many supertall buildings. The sturdy foundation system, relying on concrete bored piles with post grouting, can support substantial gravity loads. The core-outrigger-mega frame system provides sufficient lateral stiffness and strength to resist significant lateral loads and satisfies the strict story drift ratio.</li><li>The tower features a unique crystal crown that resembles a four-petal yellow Osmanthus flower. The crown structure consists of eight mega columns at perimeter and the flange walls at center, supporting a helipad and a hanging structure for the tuned mass damper (TMD).</li><li>The top of the tower is designed to meet the H10 requirements of Japanese standards, which means only 10% of people can feel building motion during a 10-year wind event. Our creative solution combines two damping systems, a 300-ton TMD and a tuned sloshing damper (TSD) based on the 1000-ton water tank. This marks the first time this approach has been adopted for a supertall building.</li><li>The TMD is suspended by a unique structural device with multiple hanging masses that can swing in opposite directions, making it more efficient than a traditional single mass damper.</li></ul>",

    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\">    Webb often gets called the replacement for Hubble, but we prefer to call it a successor. After all, Webb is the scientific successor to Hubble; its science goals were motivated by results from Hubble. Hubble's science pushed us to look to longer wavelengths to \"go beyond\" what Hubble has already done. In particular, more distant objects are more highly redshifted, and their light is pushed from the UV and optical into the near-infrared. Thus observations of these distant objects (like the first galaxies formed in the Universe, for example) requires an infrared telescope. </p><div class=\"embed\"><iframe class=\"embed-youtube\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tnbSIbsF4t4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen ></iframe></div><p class=\"paragraph\">    This is the other reason that Webb is not a replacement for Hubble; its capabilities are not identical. Webb will primarily look at the Universe in the infrared, while Hubble studies it primarily at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths (though it has some infrared capability). Webb also has a much bigger mirror than Hubble. This larger light collecting area means that Webb can peer farther back into time than Hubble is capable of doing. Hubble is in a very close orbit around the earth, while Webb will be 1.5 million kilometers (km) away at the second Lagrange (L2) point.    </p><figure class=\"fig-img\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img   \" src=\"https://chronopin.blob.core.windows.net/thumb/79f07bbc-ae6f-481a-b14e-8a5d25cf9965-chrono-lg.webp\" alt=\"EM Spectrum and satellites\" height=\"232\" width=\"649\"><figcaption class=\"fig-cap\">EM Spectrum and satellites</figcaption></figure><h3>Wavelength</h3><p class=\"paragraph\">    Webb will observe primarily in the infrared and will have four science instruments to capture images and spectra of astronomical objects. These instruments will provide wavelength coverage from 0.6 to 28 micrometers (or \"microns\"; 1 micron is 1.0 x 10-6&nbsp;meters). The infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum goes from about 0.75 microns to a few hundred microns. This means that Webb's instruments will work primarily in the infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum, with some capability in the visible range (in particular in the red and up to the yellow part of the visible spectrum).    </p><p class=\"paragraph\">    The instruments on Hubble can observe a small portion of the infrared spectrum from 0.8 to 2.5 microns, but its primary capabilities are in the ultra-violet and visible parts of the spectrum from 0.1 to 0.8 microns.    </p><figure class=\"fig-img\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img   \" src=\"https://chronopin.blob.core.windows.net/thumb/2c8f1254-d587-4a4d-be9c-18ef6f9a39b7-chrono-lg.webp\" alt=\"Hubble's visible and infrared views of the Monkey Head Nebula.

One reason Webb will be able to see the first galaxies is because it is an infrared telescope. The universe (and thus the galaxies in it) is expanding. When we talk about the most distant objects, Einstein's General Relativity actually comes into play. It tells us that the expansion of the universe means it is the space between objects that actually stretches, causing objects (galaxies) to move away from each other. Furthermore, any light in that space will also stretch, shifting that light's wavelength to longer wavelengths. This can make distant objects very dim (or invisible) at visible wavelengths of light, because that light reaches us as infrared light. Infrared telescopes, like Webb, are ideal for observing these early galaxies.    </p><h3>What About Herschel?</h3><figure class=\"fig-img\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img   \" src=\"https://chronopin.blob.core.windows.net/thumb/fd4a25ce-6685-4ea2-b0ba-3fc32df705c2-chrono-lg.webp\" alt=\"Infrared image of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) taken by Herschel (orange) with an X-ray image from XMM-Newton superposed over it (blue).

They all improve what came before them by conjuring up exciting new gameplay mechanics, developing characters through engaging stories, and switching up mission design to offer variety. In other words, they take a solid base and combine with new elements to create more advanced bonds, much like an alloy‚Ä¶ or in this case, an Aloy. Horizon Forbidden West does this with aplomb, building on the already impressive foundations of 2017‚Äôs&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/20/horizon-zero-dawn-review\">Horizon Zero Dawn</a>&nbsp;to tell a thrilling story full of familiar explosive combat against elaborate robotic foes and blockbuster action sequences, but also adding Witcher-like settlements to the map and filling it out with great side quests. There‚Äôs a genuine sense of exploration and loads of completely involving lore behind it all to uncover. The result is a fantastic open-world action-adventure that, despite falling into a couple of its old habits, emphatically delivers on the promises made five years ago. </p>",

But more than anything else I was in near-constant awe ‚Äì from the many absolutely jaw-dropping vistas, the sheer scope of an absolutely enormous world, the frequently harrowing enemies, and the way in which Elden Ring nearly always rewarded my curiosity with either an interesting encounter, a valuable reward, or something even greater.

    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> Like many of developer Supermassive‚Äôs previous games, The Quarry is clearly made both by and for people who love horror movies. From the start, it slowly builds tension and atmosphere, getting you invested by constantly asking you to make small decisions that will guide its teenage cast of potential murder victims. By the time the blood started flying, every choice felt like one more step in a rolling disaster, and that made it nearly impossible to put down. When I went back to replay it again, however, it was impossible to ignore just how non-interactive much of The Quarry actually is. As a spiritual sequel to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/24/until-dawn-review\">Until Dawn</a>, it's a better movie, but a worse game. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> You follow the story of nine camp counselors who get stuck in the woods for one more night at the end of the summer, with nothing to do but throw one last party before they go back to their lives. There's something stalking them from the treeline (because of course there is) and your choices determine which, if any, of the counselors will be able to survive the night. This setup layers three fairly textbook horror plots on top of each other as you progress, but you can tell that Supermassive Games had a lot of fun figuring out how to connect them together. When you play, you may think you're in one type of horror movie, but you're often in another. </p>",

    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> Growing up as a child of the 90s, whenever I stepped into an arcade, I‚Äôd always do a walk around to see what they had before putting my quarters into any machines. This usually didn‚Äôt last very long because as soon as I saw a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cabinet, I‚Äôd shout to my friends ‚ÄúThey got Turtles!‚Äù and we‚Äôd rush on over. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> It‚Äôs abundantly clear that the developers at Tribute Games share a similar love for the 90s TMNT beat-em-ups. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder‚Äôs Revenge is nothing but unwaveringly reverent to the classic 1989 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Arcade game, and more prominently, 1991‚Äôs Turtles in Time. Best of all, it transforms the arcadey quarter-munching design of combat into something much more skill forward while still maintaining the same button mashy appeal. Put simply, Shredder‚Äôs Revenge is a prime example of how to breathe new life into a classic arcade beat-em-up. </p>",

And it‚Äôs all about the story, since this is a choose-your-own-adventure-style graphic novel that cleverly pulls ideas from games like Telltale‚Äôs&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/12/12/the-walking-dead-the-game-review\">The Walking Dead</a>&nbsp;series and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/13-sentinels-aegis-rim-review\">13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim</a>. Each member of this voice-acting cast of unique and interesting characters has their own, often conflicting emotional stakes that accelerate the story in seemingly hundreds of logical and intelligently connected directions. Through the powerful and often far-reaching consequences of your own actions, this small town is gradually unveiled as a powder keg full of secrets, vices, and familial bonds that run far deeper than any outsider is initially led to expect. </p>",

Of course, while this third entry evolves in some key areas that make the epic journey more consistently fun than the two mainline games that came before it, it also repeats some of the same mistakes, including sloppy writing, weak bosses, and graphics that often leave something to be desired. Even so, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is already competing for the spot as my favorite iteration of this beloved series. </p>",

By essentially inventing a new single-player sport, OlliOlli World developer Roll7 has found enough ways to make both sides of this unique coin shine without getting overwhelming. Wrap that package in an intriguing world with more going on beyond the sport than you might expect, and I‚Äôve found myself lost in match after match of skate-shooting mayhem. </p>",

Splatoon 3‚Äôs campaign ‚Äî dubbed The Return of the Mammalians ‚Äî starts in territory so familiar that I was initially worried I was about to spend the next several hours slogging through tutorials on fundamentals I‚Äôd learned two games ago. Thankfully, the rug was quickly pulled out from under me, leading to a brand-new take on the series‚Äô hub world design mixed with some of the best ideas of Splatoon 2‚Äôs Octo Expansion. Splatoon 3 boldly let me decide on whether or not to blaze my own path toward any of its 70 bite-sized, inventive missions, and choose where to go next when exploring its fuzzy ooze-filled world. A lot of the enemies I found there were unchanged from previous Splatoons, but I had a great time navigating the large variety of objectives all the way to the campaign‚Äôs explosively satisfying finale. </p>",

    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> Like a sugar-crazed child working their way to the bottom of a Halloween bag full of treats, A Plague Tale: Requiem is confident that the things which made the first game great will be even more delectable in ludicrous quantities. You liked massive swarms of rats? Well, how about we increase the number of them by a degree of 1,000! You enjoyed a gruesome and harrowing journey that tested the limits of your emotional resilience? Great, let‚Äôs increase your personal suffering by 200%! This follow-up to one of my favorite action-adventure games of the previous console generation turns the dials up to 11 in practically every way, and overwhelmingly benefits from those escalations despite sometimes being a bit heavy on the nihilism. With improved stealth action mechanics, a fantastic (and deeply depressing) story, and graphics that had me gawking, A Plague Tale: Requiem is an impressive glow up that‚Äôs easily worth the immense horrors it subjected me to. </p>",

    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> When a game hits on a good idea, some developers are content to play it safe for the sequel, making a few refinements but largely stick to what worked the first time. That totally makes sense. But Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope is not that kind of sequel; even though&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/28/mario-rabbids-kingdom-battle-review\">Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle</a>&nbsp;surprised us all with its smart&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/24/xcom-2-war-of-the-chosen-review\">XCOM</a>-style tactics in Nintendo clothing, this followup maintains its best ideas but reinvents itself to the point where it immediately feels very different. It‚Äôs bigger and better in nearly every way, with a more freeform and customizable take on combat and an almost completely rethought overworld that‚Äôs much less linear and absolutely packed with puzzles. The story‚Äôs all over the place and the Switch can‚Äôt always handle everything smoothly, but it‚Äôs a fantastic game that can be played as either an enjoyable cakewalk or a deep, demanding tactical challenge, all while maintaining its zany sense of humor. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Picking back up in the post-Rabbid invasion Mushroom Kingdom, things immediately get even weirder when a giant manta ray from space arrives to cause trouble. The story is actually one of Sparks of Hope‚Äôs few missteps: the original‚Äôs trans-dimensional blending of Mario characters and goofball Rabbids is completely absurd, but it kind of makes sense in its own way. This time, though, the completely unrelated enemy spreads what‚Äôs effectively Ganon‚Äôs corrupt ooze with eyeballs from Breath of the Wild everywhere, and most but not all of her minions are also Rabbids for some reason? Also we have a spaceship for traveling between literal worlds? It makes Kingdom Battle look grounded in reality by comparison, which is something I never thought I‚Äôd say about that game. I wasn‚Äôt expecting deep lore or anything, but it‚Äôs kind of a mess. It does consistently have some pretty good jokes, though, so at least I was chuckling as I was scratching my head. </p>",

It‚Äôs just incredible to look at, feels equally amazing to play, and is jam packed with opportunities for style and creativity thanks to the wide assortment of wild weapons at your disposal. Bayonetta 3 just further cements its legacy, strutting out with a surprising sequel in that it actually takes a lot of risks with changing up its established formula in an effort to revitalize a combat system that only slightly evolved between the first two games. Fortunately those risks pay off. Bayonetta 3 is an invigorated sequel with fresh new ideas that embolden its 13-year-old combat system, an impressive amount of variety throughout its 10 to 12-hour campaign, and more of that trademark sexy Bayonetta style that makes the series one of a kind. </p>",

This is&nbsp;the&nbsp;Call of Duty experience, deconstructed, reconsidered, and obsessively optimized over 15 uninterrupted years of iteration. I know when I'm playing a Black Ops game because it has offbeat arcade modes and the latest iteration of Nuketown. I know I'm playing a Modern Warfare game because the shooting is so finely tuned that I want to take my Gunsmith build out to dinner. Infinity Ward has officially mastered the instant gratification of aiming down sights and deleting targets. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> That goes a long way, though some of Modern Warfare 2's biggest swings, such as revamped progression and a genre-bending campaign, are less elegant. It also suffers from an obtuse UI, fits of crashes, weird bugs, and the unexplained absence of basic features like stat tracking. But altogether, it's a good year for Call of Duty. </p>",

    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> How do you follow up on one of the greatest video games of all time? Sony Santa Monica finds itself in a situation not dissimilar to when Francis Ford Coppola created the sequel to his mob movie masterpiece, The Godfather. Like part two of the Corleone story, God of War Ragnarok puts a fierce, younger member of the family directly under the microscope. In doing so it manages to reach the heights of its predecessor and, in some ways, even tower above it. The writing, performances, and music are each exceptional, bringing this expansive Norse tapestry to life ‚Äì but even as it holds your heart in one hand with its elegantly told story it‚Äôs crunching bones in the other with fantastically ferocious combat. It all binds together to forge a monumental action epic that adds yet another impressive landmark to the video game landscape. </p>",

But from the moment I left the hallowed halls of Uva Academy, that promise has been wonderfully fulfilled, with open-world, open-ended gameplay serving as a shining beacon for the future of this beloved franchise. And yet, a finger on the cursed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-scarlet-violet/Mankey\">Mankey</a>‚Äôs paw has curled anyway ‚Äì Scarlet and Violet‚Äôs wonderfully innovative design is dramatically undermined by the numerous ways in which they feel deeply unfinished, with issues ranging from an incomplete world to massive and ubiquitous technical problems. So even though I want to celebrate how this generation reinvents and reinvigorates the world of Pok√©mon, I can‚Äôt without putting a great big warning label on it. </p>",

    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ign.com/games/dead-space\">proper remake</a>&nbsp;might be rising from the grave next year, but the festering corpse of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ign.com/games/dead-space-2008\">Dead Space</a>&nbsp;has come lurching back to life early in the form of The Callisto Protocol. This spiritual successor to the sci-fi survival horror series recreates the haunting blood-streaked hallways and space zombie-slaying hallmarks first established on the USG Ishimura back in 2008, and injects the gore with more awe than ever before thanks to some strikingly detailed splashes of blood and guts. Unfortunately, while the mutant dismemberment has never been more vivid, The Callisto Protocol‚Äôs shortcomings appear just as clearly. Occasional control annoyances, imbalanced combat, and a general absence of innovation result in a roughly eight-hour massacre that‚Äôs gratifyingly gruesome, but never quite as great as the series that inspired it. </p>",

    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> One of my favorite things about watching superheroes duke it out is when someone gets smacked so hard they fly backwards and crash through solid walls, explode tanker trucks, or slam into their friends. It‚Äôs an awesome demonstration of just how strong these godlike characters are supposed to be, and it‚Äôs always a disappointment when a superhero game doesn‚Äôt quite capture that feeling. With Marvel‚Äôs Midnight Suns, however, Firaxis has built a deep and innovative turn-based tactical combat system around the joy of having Iron Man, Dr. Strange, Blade, and more knock enemies around like toys they're trying to break ‚Äì and that hasn‚Äôt gotten old in the roughly 75 hours of its surprisingly expansive RPG campaign. A lot of that time isn‚Äôt spent in battles, though, and while it‚Äôs certainly appealing to get up close and personal with this cast of more than a dozen popular and lesser-known Marvel heroes, it does tend to go a bit overboard with convincing Earth‚Äôs mightiest heroes to all be your BFFs. </p>",

    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\">    In an effort to combat the devastating drought conditions hitting California, the Golden State will become the first in the nation to install solar panel canopies over canals.    </p><p class=\"paragraph\">    The $20 million pilot project funded by the state has been dubbed \"<a href=\"https://www.tid.org/about-tid/current-projects/project-nexus/\" target=\"_blank\">Project Nexus</a>.\" It will consist of an estimated 8,500 feet of solar panels installed over three sections of Turlock Irrigation District (TID) canals in Central California. The installation process is expected to begin by 2023, and be completed by 2024.    </p><p class=\"paragraph\">    The project, first announced in February, was initiated by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://solaraquagrid.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Solar AquaGrid</a>&nbsp;‚Äî a Bay Area development firm focused on innovative solutions to address water and energy issues. They have partnered with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.citizengroup.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Citizen Group</a>&nbsp;organization and TID to kick-start Project Nexus.&nbsp; &nbsp;    </p><p class=\"paragraph\">    According to TID, the project aims to use water and energy management hand-in-hand. The project is designed to increase renewable power generation, while reducing water evaporation and vegetative growth in canals.    </p><p class=\"paragraph\">    TID states that the project will also serve as a \"proof of concept\" to further study \"solar over canal design.\" The agency cites a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://escholarship.org/content/qt8cj5j07p/qt8cj5j07p.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2021 University of California, Merced study</a>, which showed that covering all of the approximately 4,000 miles of public water delivery system infrastructure in the state with solar panels could save an estimated 63 billion gallons of water annually, as well as&nbsp; result in significant energy and cost savings.&nbsp;    </p><p class=\"paragraph\">    \"According to the study, the 13 gigawatts of solar power the panels would generate each year would equal about one-sixth of the state's current installed capacity,\" TID wrote on its website.&nbsp;    </p>",

Weddings and travel skyrocketed, but so did lost luggage and global inflation rates. Taylor Swift broke Ticketmaster. Cryptocurrency was headed toward a great year until it really, really wasn‚Äôt. 2022 tested the world population as we tested out life in a new phase of the pandemic. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Russia invaded Ukraine, and aid relief flooded into the war-torn country. Refugees were welcomed into surrounding countries, and those who stayed behind inspired people around the world. Global protests cried out for justice in Iran. Football teams stood up for migrant workers and the LGBTQ+ community at the World Cup. Cuba legalized same-sex marriage. The world froze for a moment when England‚Äôs longest-reigning monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, died. And we all watched a lot of TikTok.  </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> As we head into 2023, take a moment to look back at the events that defined this year. </p>",

    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> Never mind the numerous necromorphs, the tortured torsos sprouting out of walls, or the terrifyingly towering space sphincter ‚Äì the thing I was most scared of going into the Dead Space remake is that it wouldn't live up to my fond memories of the fantastically horrific 2008 original. After just over 12 hours spent stalking through the revitalized USG Ishimura I‚Äôm happy to report that of the many things to legitimately fear about this haunted space hulk, that was not one of them. This new Dead Space enhances the original in almost every way, using a Plasma Cutter to drop its ugliest appendages on the cutting room floor while preserving the essence of what made its distinctly dismemberment-heavy shooting so special, and grafting on welcome new character details in order to present its creepy sci-fi horror story in its very best light ‚Äì and its most intimidating shadows. </p>",

In that time, we‚Äôve gotten some respectable&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/06/29/lego-harry-potter-years-1-4-review\">LEGO Potter games</a>, an underwhelming EA Sports Quidditch game for some reason, and even suffered through the fevered nightmare that is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ign.com/videos/harry-potter-for-kinect-launch-trailer\">Harry Potter Kinect</a>. But none of these has come close to fulfilling that fantasy of receiving a Hogwarts admission letter that opens the door to a secret world. With Hogwarts Legacy, I‚Äôm happy to say that we finally got a Harry Potter game that captures some of that magic. Its open world map absolutely nails the vibe of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, it has spellcasting combat that‚Äôs stupefyingly good, the characters that inhabit it are charming and unforgettable, and it is positively brimming with countless diversions to soak up dozens of hours of your time. It may not be the most impressive technical achievement and it is certainly cursed with a lack of enemy variety, but none of Hogwarts Legacy‚Äôs issues can cast a Descendo charm on this triumphant visit to the Wizarding World. </p>",

With all of that, including a few features you don‚Äôt see on even more expensive PC VR headsets like Valve‚Äôs Index and HP‚Äôs Reverb G2, the PlayStation VR2 has vaulted console VR into the lead in just about every category‚Ä¶ except available games.  \"}},{\"id\":\"OTmD6ONYt1\",\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"data\":{\"text\":\"<chronodollar class=\\\"chrono-dollar-highlight\\\">$SONY</chronodollar>&nbsp;\"}}],\"version\":\"2.26.5\"}",

And now we‚Äôre back, in outer space‚Ä¶ okay, okay, don‚Äôt leave! I‚Äôll stop. The point is that with vastly expanded combat options, bigger, more open maps, vastly more abilities to play with, and enough collectable stuff to fill a Correllian freighter, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is in many ways the Batman: Arkham City to Fallen Order‚Äôs Arkham Asylum. And much like the Arkham games did for Batman, nothing else convincingly captures playing as a Force user quite as well as this. </p>",

Even so, when I hit the start button on this 2023 remake of the legendary 2005 action-horror game I wasn‚Äôt prepared for how forcefully it would knock my knees out from under me and suplex me headfirst into 16 hours of sustained tension and exhilaration. This fully revitalised campaign dramatically one-ups the original in almost every conceivable way. Its Spanish countryside setting is substantially more sinister, its pacing has been tightened to the point where hardly a single minute is wasted, and its controls have been modernised in order to allow its signature dynamic shooting mechanics to really shine. I‚Äôve been waiting 18 years for a game to thrill me in the same way as Resident Evil 4; as it turns out, this whole time I‚Äôve just been waiting for another Resident Evil 4. </p>",

Ai confides in Gorou that as an orphan, she wanted to experience the happiness of raising her own family, but at the same time does not want to give up her idol career so she intends to raise her children in secret. Gorou swears to make sure Ai gives birth to healthy babies and takes care of her for the rest of her pregnancy. However, on Ai's due date, Gorou is confronted by a man stalking Ai and ends up being pushed off a cliff, dying at the same moment Ai goes into labor. He then wakes up and discovers he has been reborn as Ai's son Aquamarine and lives together with her and his twin sister Ruby. Ruby herself is the reincarnation of Sarina, but she does not tell Aqua her previous identity. Ai's manager Ichigo Saitou then begins making plans for Ai's comeback, arranging for his wife Miyako to take care of the twins while Ai is performing.

    "title": "What to Expect From WWDC 2023: AR/VR Headset, 15-Inch MacBook Air, Mac Studio, iOS 17, xrOS, macOS 14 and More",
    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\">   Apple is expected to introduce its first new wearable since the launch of the Apple Watch, plus there are new Macs coming and notable features for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/\">watchOS 10</a>. This guide highlights everything rumored to be coming at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/\">WWDC 2023</a>.   </p><h2>Hardware</h2><p class=\"paragraph\">   We don't always get hardware at WWDC, and in fact, the event usually focuses on software. Every once in awhile, though, Apple has a new product to show off that's timed well for a June launch, and that's the case this year.   </p><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ar-vr/\">AR/VR Headset</a></h3><p class=\"paragraph\">   Apple's AR/VR headset has been in active development for years now, and Apple has pushed it back several times to work out ongoing issues. We're expecting to get our first glimpse at the headset at WWDC, though it is not expected to officially launch until later in the year.   </p><p class=\"paragraph\">   The headset is expected to have a thin and light design that will make it more comfortable to wear than competing products, and the lighter weight will be primarily facilitated by an external battery pack that's worn at the hip and connected to the headset through a USB-C cable. Apple wants the headset to weigh around 200 grams, which would be notably lighter than other options.  </p><p class=\"paragraph\">   Battery life will come in at around two hours, but because it's using an external battery pack, batteries will be swappable for longer wear. The headset will support both virtual reality and augmented reality, with a physical Digital Crown-like button to switch between modes.   </p><p class=\"paragraph\">   Leaked design information suggests the headset will be made from aluminum, glass, and carbon fiber, with a look that's not too far off from other VR headsets like the PlayStation VR 2 or the Oculus Quest 2. It will have a sleek front visor that's held on with an Apple Watch-like band, with a mesh that sits against the face.   </p><p class=\"paragraph\">   Two 4K microOLED displays from Sony will offer high-resolution content in a 120-degree field of view, with Apple aiming for 5,000 nits brightness for HDR and 4,000 pixels per inch. HDR is not a typical feature for VR headsets, and that pixel density will outshine all competing headsets. Prescription lenses will be accommodated, and the internal lenses will be able to be adjusted to match the wearer's interpupillary distance.   </p><p class=\"paragraph\">   More than a dozen cameras will track hand movements, leg movements, and facial gestures, plus iris scanning will be available for authentication. Capturing lower body movement is not something most headsets do, and Apple plans to use the cameras to track hand and eye gestures for control purposes. Users will, for example, be able to look at an on-screen item to select it, using hand gestures to interact with it. An \"air-typing\" feature will be available for text input, though Apple also plans to allow users to enter text with an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, similar to how the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>&nbsp;works. The cameras will also map the surrounding environment for augmented reality applications, with LiDAR scanners also included.   </p><p class=\"paragraph\">   While the headset can connect to a Mac to display what's on the Mac's screen, it is designed to operate independently. There are two Mac-level&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a>&nbsp;processors inside, one that's a higher-end chip and one that's a lower-end chip for powering sensors.   </p><p class=\"paragraph\">   The AR/VR headset will run a new operating system that's likely to be called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/xros/\">xrOS</a>, with the xr standing for \"extended reality.\" ‚ÄåxrOS‚Äå will be immediately familiar to iOS users, and Apple is developing dedicated apps for the device. Safari,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a>, Messages, Maps,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a>, and more will be optimized for a 3D interface, and it will also be able to run 2D&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>&nbsp;apps through a special 3D viewing experience, similar to how YouTube works on a device like the Meta Quest 2.   </p><p class=\"paragraph\">   Apple is developing a dedicated Fitness+ app for the headset for those who want to use the device while exercising, and Health features will guide users through meditations. There will be a media focus with Apple planning to provide a dedicated TV app, and Apple is teaming up with companies like Disney and Dolby for content.   </p><p class=\"paragraph\">   Apple is already working with gaming developers to help them update their existing content for mixed reality, and ‚ÄåFaceTime‚Äå will also be a focus. ‚ÄåFaceTime‚Äå will support one-on-one chats with realistic avatars featuring a user's actual face and body, while multi-person chats will use Memojis.   </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> <chronodollar class=\"chrono-dollar-highlight\">$AAPL</chronodollar>&nbsp; </p>",

Users will, for example, be able to look at an on-screen item to select it, using hand gestures to interact with it. An \\\"air-typing\\\" feature will be available for text input, though Apple also plans to allow users to enter text with an&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\\\">iPhone</a>, similar to how the&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\\\">Apple TV</a>&nbsp;works.

    "title": "Final Fantasy 16: Release Date, Story, And Everything We Know",
    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\">   Six years have passed since the last mainline installment in the decidedly not-so-final Final Fantasy series, making this one of the largest gaps between games in the series' 35 years of history. However, all that waiting seems to be for good reason. What we've seen from Final Fantasy XVI makes the game look like a high-fantasy epic combining the grandeur of older titles with the cutting-edge technology of newer games, making us hopeful that this next entry will be well worth the wait.   </p><p class=\"paragraph\">  It's worth noting, however, that the game will not be cross-generation, meaning PS4 owners will have to make the move to PS5 in order to play it. Square Enix shared this news during the game's reveal trailer, noting, \"The following content is captured on PC emulating the PS5 experience,\" before adding the latest entry in the Final Fantasy saga will, \"not [be] available on other platforms for a limited time after release on PS5.\" </p><div class=\"embed\"><iframe class=\"embed-youtube\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aPT26Dd3OzE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen ></iframe></div><h2>Gameplay</h2><p class=\"paragraph\">  FFXVI takes on an action-RPG style of combat and looks like it shares similarities to FFXV and FF7 Remake. This is not all that surprising, given&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-dumped-traditional-turn-based-combat-so-that-it-could-appeal-to-younger-gamers/1100-6505477/\">producer Naoki Yoshida's sentiments regarding turn-based systems and their lack of allure to younger gamers</a>. In battle, protagonist Clive can cast fireballs, engage at melee range with his sword and warp-like abilities, and use a few powers that look like they're tied to Eikons (indicated by the stone fist summoned in the fight against a Dragoon).  </p><p class=\"paragraph\">  While Clive is the central character and the player protagonist, he won't be the only adventurer on a quest. Clive will be accompanied by AI-controlled party members who will banter and connect throughout the game, as well as a \"faithful buddy\" character to whom you can give direct commands to. Clive, though, will remain the central character, and the game will follow him through three periods in his life: his teens, 20s, and 30s.  </p><p class=\"paragraph\">  Ryota Suzuki, who was a combat designer for Devil May Cry 5 and Dragon's Dogma, is the battle director for FFXVI, which could result in something quite exciting. And despite this renewed focus on action, producer Naoki Yoshida noted that this new approach will<a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-will-be-more-action-oriented-but-not-at-the-expense-of-its-story/1100-6487880/\">&nbsp;not come at the expense of the game's story</a>.  </p><p class=\"paragraph\">  During April's State of Play, PlayStation and Square Enix<a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-xvi-state-of-play-showcases-real-time-combat-and-world-exploration/1100-6513260/\">&nbsp;showed off 20 minutes of gameplay</a>&nbsp;that revealed more about combat, world exploration, story, and side content. Real-time action combat, which is relatively new for the franchise, will see Clive fighting enemies using his powerful abilities and with Eikons that he can control. You'll be able to customize Clive throughout his adventure by investing experience into his massive skill tree, and those abilities can be reset at any time during your journey.  </p><p class=\"paragraph\">  To explore the world, players can travel to different locations via a world map, which will be updated with new and evolving areas as the game progresses. Final Fantasy XVI won't be an open-world game, and there will instead be several levels to explore, some of which have been rendered in extreme detail. Cid's Hideaway, a headquarters for Clive, will be unlocked later in the game and is where the protagonist can upgrade his gear, buy new weapons and armor, train in a special area, and pick up new side quests.  </p><p class=\"paragraph\">  With this entry in the series sporting hard-hitting melee action combat and huge action set-pieces, some Final Fantasy fans have compared the game to Sony's God of War series.<a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-xvi-is-a-lot-like-god-of-war-and-its-director-knows-it/1100-6511847/\">&nbsp;Takai has acknowledged those influences</a>, and the mission structure of Final Fantasy XVI follows very closely to the more recent God of War games, but Final Fantasy XVI has also been influenced by other movies, games, and anime.  </p><h2>How long will it take to complete Final Fantasy XVI?</h2><p class=\"paragraph\">  Game director Hiroshi Takai and producer Naoki Yoshida estimate that<a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-xvi-will-reportedly-take-nearly-80-hours-to-complete-everything/1100-6512453/\">&nbsp;the base game can be completed in around 35 hours</a>, but for completionists looking to finish 100% of the game, expect around 70 to 80 hours to earn that achievement.  </p><h2>Behind the scenes</h2><p class=\"paragraph\">  In addition to the detailed reveal trailer, Square Enix also launched<a href=\"https://na.finalfantasyxvi.com/\">&nbsp;an official website</a>&nbsp;with in-depth looks at FFXVI's new world and characters to get you started on understanding the backstory. What's notable about this entry, in particular, is that it's being developed by Creative Business Unit III--which is the not-so-flashy name for the division behind the incredible MMORPG<a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online-a-realm-reborn/\">&nbsp;Final Fantasy XIV</a>.  </p><p class=\"paragraph\">  It's promising given that Naoki Yoshida is leading production on FFXVI--he led the team behind the rebirth of FFXIV and continues to direct the MMO, which keeps getting better and is regarded as top-tier in video game storytelling. FFXVI itself is being directed by Hiroshi Takai, who has a lengthy history with Final Fantasy and Square Enix, and was even part of developing FFXIV's reboot.  </p><div class=\"embed\"><iframe class=\"embed-youtube\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LT7SE_Uffe0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen ></iframe></div>",

    "title": "Meta Quest 3 Coming This Fall",
    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Cs809N-BUJ7/\">Mark Zuckerberg just announced</a>&nbsp;Meta Quest 3, our next-generation virtual and mixed reality headset, which launches later this year. It features higher resolution, stronger performance, breakthrough&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/mixed-reality-definition-passthrough-scene-understanding-spatial-anchors/\">Meta Reality</a>&nbsp;technology, and a slimmer, more comfortable form factor. Quest 3 will ship in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.meta.com/help/orders-and-returns/articles/quest-2-supported-countries/\">all countries where Meta Quest is currently supported</a>&nbsp;this fall. The 128GB headset starts at $499.99 USD, and we‚Äôll offer an additional storage option for those who want some extra space. Mark your calendars because we‚Äôll have lots more to share at Meta Connect, which returns this year on September 27. </p><h2>Our Most Powerful Headset Yet</h2><p class=\"paragraph\"> Quest 3 combines our highest resolution display and pancake optics to make content look better than ever. To power those extra pixels, this will be the first headset to feature a next-generation Snapdragon chipset developed in collaboration with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.qualcomm.com/home\">Qualcomm Technologies</a>. That next-gen Snapdragon chipset delivers more than twice the graphical performance as the previous generation Snapdragon GPU in Quest 2 ‚Äî meaning you‚Äôll get smoother performance and incredibly crisp details in immersive games.&nbsp; </p><h2>Immersive VR + Breakthrough Meta Reality in a Single Device</h2><p class=\"paragraph\"> On Quest 3, our best-in-class Meta Reality technology lets you seamlessly blend your physical world with the virtual one. These new experiences go beyond today‚Äôs mixed reality by intelligently understanding and responding to objects in your physical space and allowing you to navigate that space in natural, intuitive ways that were nearly impossible before. High-fidelity color Passthrough, innovative machine learning, and spatial understanding let you interact with virtual content and the physical world simultaneously, creating limitless possibilities to explore. Now you can play a virtual board game on your kitchen table with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3634830803298285/\"><i>Demeo</i></a>, decorate your living room with virtual art courtesy of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3106117596158066/\"><i>Painting VR,</i></a>&nbsp;or dive into a fully immersive world to do things that are simply not possible otherwise.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Quest 3 makes Meta Reality available to even more people and at a lower price point, making it our first mass-market offering to deliver both cutting-edge VR and MR experiences in a single device, setting a new benchmark for future headsets. </p><h2>Redesigned for Comfort + Control</h2><p class=\"paragraph\"> With a 40% slimmer optic profile* compared to Quest 2, Quest 3 is a sleeker, more comfortable headset. We also completely redesigned Quest 3‚Äôs Touch Plus controllers with a more streamlined and ergonomic form factor. Thanks to our advances in tracking technology, we‚Äôve dropped the outer tracking rings so the controllers feel like a more natural extension of your hands and take up less space. We also included TruTouch haptics that first debuted in Touch Pro to help you feel the action like never before. You can even upgrade to our fully self-tracked&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.meta.com/quest/accessories/quest-touch-pro-controllers-and-charging-dock/\">Meta Quest Touch Pro Controllers</a>&nbsp;for a premium experience. And hand tracking will be supported out of the box, so you can explore without controllers, thanks to Direct Touch that lets you use just your hands to interact with virtual objects. </p><h2>World‚Äôs Best Library of Immersive Content</h2><p class=\"paragraph\"> Quest 3 is compatible with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.meta.com/quest/products/quest-2/\">Quest 2</a>&nbsp;catalog of over 500 VR games, apps, and experiences (and counting), and we‚Äôve got even more exciting new VR and MR titles lined up for launch. That means Quest 3 will have the world‚Äôs best library of immersive experiences on day one. Be sure to tune in to today‚Äôs&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC766vkQw0Mz3VtXX5XvXxGQ\">Meta Quest Gaming Showcase</a>&nbsp;for a rundown of new games and updates coming to the Quest Platform ‚Äî plus a sneak peek at Quest 3‚Äôs AAA flagship adventure. </p><h2>Quest 2 Gets New Lower Prices, Plus a Performance Upgrade</h2><p class=\"paragraph\"> We‚Äôre excited for Quest 3 and look forward to sharing more later this year at Connect. But what about Quest 2? </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> <a href=\"https://www.meta.com/quest/products/quest-2/\">Meta Quest 2</a>&nbsp;changed the face of VR when it first hit the scene in 2020, ushering in a new era of gaming, fitness, and more. It‚Äôs already one of the most affordable ways to get into VR ‚Äî and it‚Äôs about to get even better. Starting June 4, we‚Äôre lowering the price of Quest 2 to $299.99 USD for the 128GB SKU and $349.99 USD for the 256GB SKU, helping even more people access the magic of all-in-one VR and our vast content library. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> But that‚Äôs not all! In an upcoming software update, we‚Äôre updating the Quest 2 and Quest Pro GPU and CPU. Quest 2 and Pro will see an up-to 26% CPU performance increase with an up-to 19% GPU speed increase for Quest 2 and 11% for Quest Pro. As developers take advantage of these changes, you can expect smoother gameplay, a more responsive UI, and richer content on both headsets. And we‚Äôre enabling Dynamic Resolution Scaling for both Quest 2 and Quest Pro, so games and apps can take advantage of increased pixel density without dropping frames. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> While Quest 3 sets a new standard for mixed reality, immersive gaming, and what a mainstream VR headset can be, Quest 2 remains our most affordable entry point to VR and Pro is optimized for work use cases, with face and eye tracking for more authentic self-expression in meetings. We‚Äôll continue to sell Quest 2 and Pro alongside Quest 3, as well as continue shipping new software updates to make the Quest experience even better. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> From games, to fitness apps, professional collaboration tools and more, Quest has something for everyone. And we can‚Äôt wait to welcome even more people to the Meta Quest community. </p>",

    "description": "<h2>The MI300X</h2><p class=\"paragraph\"> AMD said that its new MI300X chip and its CDNA architecture were designed for large language models and other cutting-edge AI models. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> ‚ÄúAt the center of this are GPUs. GPUs are enabling generative AI,‚Äù Su said. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The MI300X can use up to 192GB of memory, which means it can fit even bigger AI models than other chips. Nvidia‚Äôs rival H100 only supports 120GB of memory, for example. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Large language models for generative AI applications use lots of memory because they run an increasing number of calculations.

The Adventure Van would harken back to the days when you could roll into your local Volkswagen or Toyota dealer and leave with a Westfalia or Chinook. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> PLATFORM AND POWERTRAIN:&nbsp;Although Rivian could conceivably build the Adventure Van from its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.motortrend.com/news/2022-rivian-prime-delivery-van-first-look-review/\">commercial-oriented Prime Van</a>&nbsp;or RCV, we believe it'll instead use the more off-road-capable platform under the R1T pickup and R1S SUV. Hard details from our sources are scarce, as it's still early days for the Adventure Van, but we believe it will be available with multiple battery and motor options and come standard with the company's trick hydropneumatic suspension. We suspect&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.motortrend.com/news/rivian-r1t-r1s-two-motor-standard-battery-pack-details/\">both dual- and quad-motor powertrains</a>&nbsp;will be available, with as much as 1,200 hp and 1,200 lb-ft on tap, and Rivian's 180-kWh Max battery pack. </p>",

    "title": "China Has a Youth Unemployment Problem; Guangdong Province Spearheads a Plan to Send 300,000 Youth to the Countryside by the End of 2025",
    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\">   Since the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBS) started to publish the country‚Äôs monthly unemployment rate in January 2018,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ceicdata.com/zh-hans/china/surveyed-unemployment/cn-unemployment-rate-age-16-to-24\">the unemployment rate</a>&nbsp;for young urban workers aged 16-24 (including migrant workers living in urban areas) over the past five years has increased from 11% in January 2018 to 19.9% in July 2022, then decreased slightly to 18.1% in February 2023.   </p><p class=\"paragraph\">   Combining the myriad unemployment stories posted on social media, anecdotes from college campuses, with our justified distrust of Chinese government statistics, we believe that the youth unemployment rate is far higher.   </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> This labor force is composed of recent graduates from junior high schools, high schools, vocational schools, undergraduate studies, and master‚Äôs degree programs, including returning international students to China. According to the World Bank‚Äôs&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/b8644c8a79ee3376b2cd3c16a9f90cc7-0070012022/original/CEU-December-2022-ENG.pdf\">China Economic Update</a>, Special Report on Youth Unemployment (December 2022), about 39.8 million vocational, undergraduate, and graduate students have entered the labor market in the three-year period from 2020 to 2022, and about 11.5 million more will enter the labor market in June 2023. This does not include graduates from conventional middle and high schools entering the job market. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> If the job market in China does not turn around quickly in the near future, there will be at least a few millions of young people between the ages of 16 and 24 ‚Äî including the well-educated ‚Äî&nbsp;unable to find employment. Tellingly, the phrase ‚Äúout of school equals out of work‚Äù (ÊØï‰∏öÂç≥Â§±‰∏ö) has been making headlines in Chinese media and social media in recent months. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The internet, education, manufacturing, service and entertainment industries, where young people are concentrated, have been hit hard in recent years, with severe layoffs and declining revenues, and job prospects for young people in the foreseeable future are not looking up. For those who do find jobs, job instability may be high. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> From a statistical perspective, youth unemployment does not seem to be much of a concern. Based on the China Census Yearbook 2020, a macroeconomic research report by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pdf.dfcfw.com/pdf/H301_AP202207251576517991_1.pdf\">Orient Securities</a>&nbsp;states that the share of employed people aged 16-24 in the employed population decreased from 14.3% in 2010 to 7.1% in 2020, due to changes in population age structure; the shift in the overall unemployment rate is only 0.07% for each 1% increase in the youth unemployment rate. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> However, high unemployment among the youth could be of grave political concern for the Communist Party. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Compared with previous generations of Chinese, those born after 1990 belong to the most fortunate generation in recent history: they have a better standard of living than ever before, their families have been willing to invest in them, they have grown up with more freedoms and more education, and they generally are full of optimism for the future. Many of them have studied abroad; the cultural trends they follow are heavily influenced by the West, especially the United States. Now, just as their lives seem ready to take off, the course of history may have turned: the good life they are used to may not be getting better; the period they have grown up in may well be a fleeting aberration rather than a sustainable norm. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Unlike the 1989 generation, today‚Äôs youth have not grown up with a keen interest in politics. But last November, they were the ones who&nbsp;<a href=\"https://chinachange.org/2023/02/18/hutong-dj-bars-youth-and-unexpected-politics-the-detained-blank-paper-protesters-of-beijing/\">took to the streets</a>&nbsp;across major cities to protest the cruel and foolish zero-Covid policy. We do not know the deliberations within the CCP, but following the Blank Paper protests, the CCP may begin to see young people, besieged by unemployment, as a potent destabilizing force and take more forceful measures in response to this problem. It is perfectly in line with the CCP‚Äôs logic of nipping potential threats in the bud and maintaining regime security at all costs. </p><h4>The new ‚Äúsend-down‚Äù plan</h4><p class=\"paragraph\"> On February 20, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League held a ‚Äúmobilization conference for Guangdong youth to aid in high-quality development‚Äù and officially announced a plan to send 300,000 youth to the countryside by the end of 2025, with the tongue-twisting title ‚ÄúThe three-year action plan of Guangdong youth going to the countryside, returning to the countryside, and rejuvenating the countryside to help the project of high-quality development of 100 counties, 1,000 townships, and 10,000 villages.‚Äù There have been&nbsp;<a href=\"http://dara.gd.gov.cn/mtbd5789/content/post_4098581.html\">news release</a>&nbsp;and coverage of this mobilization conference, but it wasn‚Äôt until a few days ago, when someone revealed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/whyyoutouzhele/status/1642848766897053696?s=20\">the full text</a>&nbsp;of the plan on Twitter. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The plan consists of three parts: organizing city youth to go to the countryside; mobilizing rural youth living in the city to return to the countryside; and cultivating youth in the countryside to make them stay in the countryside. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The plan to&nbsp;‚Äúorganize city youth to go the countryside‚Äù&nbsp;has three components: </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> 1) Each year,&nbsp;10,000 graduates&nbsp;from colleges in Guangdong are to be sent to less developed parts of the province for two to three years of ‚Äúvoluntary services‚Äù to provide talents to ‚Äúrural rejuvenation.‚Äù According to the plan, the young volunteers will assume the positions of Communist Youth League cadres, promoters of rural rejuvenation, and liaisons for young people returning home, and service personnel for formerly rural townships recently redesignated as urban areas. And favorable policies will follow to ‚Äúencourage and support volunteers to put their roots down.‚Äù </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> 2) Each year,&nbsp;1,000 teams of volunteers, consisting of vocational school students, are to go to the countryside during the summer to provide technology know-how to rural enterprises, startups, and government‚Äôs key projects and help train locals. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> 2) Each year,&nbsp;1,000 young entrepreneurs&nbsp;from inside and outside the province are to be recruited to participate in the development of townships and villages.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The plan to ‚Äúmobilize rural youth living in the city to return to the countryside‚Äù: Each year,&nbsp;a minimum of 30,000 college graduates&nbsp;will be sent back to where their rural household registrations are. Municipalities and counties will have a system to register local youth who have left for colleges and provide them with internship or job opportunities to incentivize them to return home. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The plan calls for ‚Äúhelping train 30,000 rural-based youth‚Äù&nbsp;each year to engage in digital commerce, farming, and cooperatives (Âêà‰ΩúÁ§æ), which was a relic of the Mao-era planned economy and is seeing a government-led comeback in rural China. The government will support 3,000 such startup projects each year by providing loans to recent college graduates returning home. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Chinese netizens and commentators immediately dubbed this plan ‚Äúthe new educated urban youth being sent down to the countryside‚Äù (Êñ∞Áü•ËØÜÈùíÂπ¥‰∏äÂ±±‰∏ã‰π°). </p>",

This enables us to consolidate our midsize and large vans down to only one architecture and significantly reduce the complexity of our product portfolio. Maximum added value for customers with sustainable profitability at the same time: VAN.EA clearly underscores our aspiration to be ‚ÄòLead in Electric‚Äô. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> To streamline production, Mercedes‚Äôs new architecture is a scalable solution with three modules. The front module stays the same in all VAN.EA variants consisting of the electric powertrain and front axle. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Meanwhile, the center module dictates the length of the vehicle, while the rear module will be available with an electric motor (for AWD) or without (FWD). </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Based on the various combinations, Mercedes will offer different versions for private and commercial customers. VAN.EA-P (for privately positioned) is designed for those looking for a mobile office, family activity vehicle, or business partner (such as a VIP shuttle) for example. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The VAN.EA-C (for premium commercial vans), on the other hand, is for the courier, express, and parcel delivery vehicles to ambulances and camper vans with added cargo space and functionality. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Mercedes already offers fully electric van variants in all segments but with the VAN.EA platform, the van division aims to achieve 50% EV sales share by 2030. </p>",

He argues human mind is specialized. It is hard to understand the specialization level of human mind as humans since we don‚Äôt know and can‚Äôt experience the entire spectrum of intelligence.</li><li>In areas where machines exhibited super-human intelligence, humans were able to beat them by leveraging machine-specific weaknesses. For example, in 2023 an amateur was able to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://research.aimultiple.com/games/#go\">beat a go program</a>&nbsp;that is on par with go programs that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://research.aimultiple.com/games/#go\">beat world champions</a>&nbsp;by studying and leveraging the program‚Äôs weaknesses.</li></ul><p class=\"paragraph\">   However, these differences do not stop humans from achieving far more than other species in terms of many typical measures of success for a species. For example, homo sapiens is the species that contribute&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/115/25/6506\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">most</a>&nbsp;to the bio-mass on the globe among mammals.   </p><figure class=\"fig-img\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img   \" src=\"https://chronopin.blob.core.windows.net/thumb/a691ca5a-cac2-443b-9477-4713dade9fc9-chrono-lg.webp\" alt=\"Intelligence is multi-dimensional\" height=\"335\" width=\"600\"><figcaption class=\"fig-cap\">Intelligence is multi-dimensional</figcaption></figure><h3>2- Intelligence is not the solution to all problems</h3><p class=\"paragraph\">   For example, even the best machine analyzing existing data will probably not be able to find a cure for cancer. It will need to run experiments and analyze results to discover new knowledge in most areas.   </p><p class=\"paragraph\">   This is true with some caveats. More intelligence can lead to better-designed and managed experiments, enabling more discovery per experiment. History of research productivity should probably demonstrate this but data is quite noisy and there are diminishing returns on research. We encounter harder problems like quantum physics as we solve simpler problems like Newtonian motion.   </p><h3>3- AGI is not possible because it is not possible to model the human brain</h3><p class=\"paragraph\">   Theoretically, it is possible to model any computational machine including the human brain with a relatively simple machine that can perform basic computations and has access to infinite memory and time. This is the Church-Turing hypothesis laid out in 1950. It is universally accepted. However as stated, it requires certain difficult conditions: infinite time and memory.   </p><p class=\"paragraph\">   Most computer scientists believe that it will take less than infinite time and memory to model the human brain. However, there is not a mathematically sound way to prove this belief as we do not understand the brain enough to exactly understand its computational power. We will just have to build such a machine!   </p><p class=\"paragraph\">   And we haven‚Äôt been successful, yet. For example, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://research.aimultiple.com/gpt/\">ChatGPT large language model</a>&nbsp;launched in November/2022 caused significant excitement with its fluency and quickly reached a million users. However, its lack of logical understanding makes its output error-prone. For a more dramatic example, this is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/i/status/890816308144558080\" rel=\"nofollow\">video</a>&nbsp;of what happens when machines play soccer. It is a bit dated (from 2017) but makes even me feel like a soccer legend in comparison.   </p><h2>To learn more about Artificial General Intelligence</h2><h3> Ray Kurzweil‚Äôs lecture:</h3><div class=\"embed\"><iframe class=\"embed-youtube\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Z06rY3uvGY\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen ></iframe></div><h3> Joshua Brett Tenenbaum, a Professor of Cognitive Science and Computation at MIT, &nbsp;is explaining how we can achieve AGI singularity: </h3><div class=\"embed\"><iframe class=\"embed-youtube\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7ROelYvo8f0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen ></iframe></div><p class=\"paragraph\">  <chronohash class=\"chrono-hash-highlight\">#AI</chronohash>  </p>",

    "description": "Based on Kardashev‚Äôs speculations where does our civilization sit today? We are Type 0, somewhere between 0.7 and 0.72 producing 15 Terawatts of energy, a mere fraction of the energy a Type 1 would harvest from the physical world. The renowned theoretical physicist, Michio Kaku, has speculated on Kardashev‚Äôs scale and believes humanity will attain Type 1 status within a century or two.",
