    "title": "Xbox One Kinect stand-alone to hit the market",
    "description": "Ever since Microsoft decoupled the Kinect sensor from the Xbox One, the one lingering question was when would they sell it as a stand-alone unit? Offering an Xbox One without the Kinect sensor made financial sense in Microsoft's struggle against Sony, but it does not mean that people may never want to want to buy the Kinect at a later point. Until now though, there was no option to do so. Windows Phone Central has now learned that Microsoft is planning to sell the stand-alone Kinect sensor for $149 beginning on or around October 6. The timing is ideal as it leads well into the holiday season in the US and other countries, making the add-on an excellent gift for those who already own an Xbox One without the next-gen accessory.",

The DT-903 is unique enough to be called 'smart' and there's a good reason for the designation. We went hands on with the new DT-903 to show you what it is all about in our latest video. Featuring Qi wireless charging, NFC for 'tap-to-pair' and Bluetooth 4.0, the new Microsoft charger not only gives your Lumia power, but it tells you when you need to charge, or even if you have a missed call or text message.",

    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild\">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>&nbsp;reinvented a 30-year-old series in a way we rarely see. After Skyward Sword offered a slightly more linear, story-driven campaign than most fans were used to, Breath of the Wild readjusted dramatically in the opposite direction. Suddenly you could go anywhere and climb anything in any order you wanted, and goodness gracious was there a whole lot to choose from. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> There are plenty of fair criticisms to throw at Breath of the Wild, with common ones being its lack of traditional Zelda dungeons and items. But what‚Äôs truly impressive is how much it maintained the heart of a Zelda game even as it altered nearly every system around it. To a certain extent, Zelda has always been about exploration and choice, and Breath of the Wild simply leaned into and enabled those aspects of itself above all else, now making the world a place that would react to those choices as well. There‚Äôs just so much to see, so many people to meet and secrets to find hidden throughout this long-since devastated version of Hyrule. </p>",

    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> From the first honk of the series‚Äô iconic countdown klaxon, there are moments during Gran Turismo 7 when it feels almost like a remake of the 1997 original. In the space of a moment I‚Äôm 16 again and stuffing earthshaking turbos into a bright red Mitsubishi GTO, wondering how I‚Äôm going to be able to beat my dad around Trial Mountain when he always gets the DualShock and I have to make do with our only other controller ‚Äì a terrible, translucent blue aftermarket job with no analogue sticks. That‚Äôs a kind of magic a video game series can‚Äôt buy; it can only earn. Gran Turismo 7 has that magic; that compulsive car upgrade loop the series established, plus the hot looks and sterling handling to back it up. But there‚Äôs a lot more to Gran Turismo 7 than the sum of its nostalgia ‚Äì even if there are still a few traditions it should‚Äôve left in its rear-view mirror. </p>",

    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> Like many of developer Supermassive‚Äôs previous games, The Quarry is clearly made both by and for people who love horror movies. From the start, it slowly builds tension and atmosphere, getting you invested by constantly asking you to make small decisions that will guide its teenage cast of potential murder victims. By the time the blood started flying, every choice felt like one more step in a rolling disaster, and that made it nearly impossible to put down. When I went back to replay it again, however, it was impossible to ignore just how non-interactive much of The Quarry actually is. As a spiritual sequel to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/24/until-dawn-review\">Until Dawn</a>, it's a better movie, but a worse game. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> You follow the story of nine camp counselors who get stuck in the woods for one more night at the end of the summer, with nothing to do but throw one last party before they go back to their lives. There's something stalking them from the treeline (because of course there is) and your choices determine which, if any, of the counselors will be able to survive the night. This setup layers three fairly textbook horror plots on top of each other as you progress, but you can tell that Supermassive Games had a lot of fun figuring out how to connect them together. When you play, you may think you're in one type of horror movie, but you're often in another. </p>",

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder‚Äôs Revenge is nothing but unwaveringly reverent to the classic 1989 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Arcade game, and more prominently, 1991‚Äôs Turtles in Time. Best of all, it transforms the arcadey quarter-munching design of combat into something much more skill forward while still maintaining the same button mashy appeal.

Each member of this voice-acting cast of unique and interesting characters has their own, often conflicting emotional stakes that accelerate the story in seemingly hundreds of logical and intelligently connected directions.

It‚Äôs bigger and better in nearly every way, with a more freeform and customizable take on combat and an almost completely rethought overworld that‚Äôs much less linear and absolutely packed with puzzles. The story‚Äôs all over the place and the Switch can‚Äôt always handle everything smoothly, but it‚Äôs a fantastic game that can be played as either an enjoyable cakewalk or a deep, demanding tactical challenge, all while maintaining its zany sense of humor. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Picking back up in the post-Rabbid invasion Mushroom Kingdom, things immediately get even weirder when a giant manta ray from space arrives to cause trouble. The story is actually one of Sparks of Hope‚Äôs few missteps: the original‚Äôs trans-dimensional blending of Mario characters and goofball Rabbids is completely absurd, but it kind of makes sense in its own way. This time, though, the completely unrelated enemy spreads what‚Äôs effectively Ganon‚Äôs corrupt ooze with eyeballs from Breath of the Wild everywhere, and most but not all of her minions are also Rabbids for some reason? Also we have a spaceship for traveling between literal worlds? It makes Kingdom Battle look grounded in reality by comparison, which is something I never thought I‚Äôd say about that game. I wasn‚Äôt expecting deep lore or anything, but it‚Äôs kind of a mess. It does consistently have some pretty good jokes, though, so at least I was chuckling as I was scratching my head. </p>",

Bayonetta 3 just further cements its legacy, strutting out with a surprising sequel in that it actually takes a lot of risks with changing up its established formula in an effort to revitalize a combat system that only slightly evolved between the first two games. Fortunately those risks pay off. Bayonetta 3 is an invigorated sequel with fresh new ideas that embolden its 13-year-old combat system, an impressive amount of variety throughout its 10 to 12-hour campaign, and more of that trademark sexy Bayonetta style that makes the series one of a kind. </p>",

This is&nbsp;the&nbsp;Call of Duty experience, deconstructed, reconsidered, and obsessively optimized over 15 uninterrupted years of iteration.

This spiritual successor to the sci-fi survival horror series recreates the haunting blood-streaked hallways and space zombie-slaying hallmarks first established on the USG Ishimura back in 2008, and injects the gore with more awe than ever before thanks to some strikingly detailed splashes of blood and guts. Unfortunately, while the mutant dismemberment has never been more vivid, The Callisto Protocol‚Äôs shortcomings appear just as clearly. Occasional control annoyances, imbalanced combat, and a general absence of innovation result in a roughly eight-hour massacre that‚Äôs gratifyingly gruesome, but never quite as great as the series that inspired it. </p>",

With Marvel‚Äôs Midnight Suns, however, Firaxis has built a deep and innovative turn-based tactical combat system around the joy of having Iron Man, Dr. Strange, Blade, and more knock enemies around like toys they're trying to break ‚Äì and that hasn‚Äôt gotten old in the roughly 75 hours of its surprisingly expansive RPG campaign. A lot of that time isn‚Äôt spent in battles, though, and while it‚Äôs certainly appealing to get up close and personal with this cast of more than a dozen popular and lesser-known Marvel heroes, it does tend to go a bit overboard with convincing Earth‚Äôs mightiest heroes to all be your BFFs. </p>",

    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> Never mind the numerous necromorphs, the tortured torsos sprouting out of walls, or the terrifyingly towering space sphincter ‚Äì the thing I was most scared of going into the Dead Space remake is that it wouldn't live up to my fond memories of the fantastically horrific 2008 original. After just over 12 hours spent stalking through the revitalized USG Ishimura I‚Äôm happy to report that of the many things to legitimately fear about this haunted space hulk, that was not one of them. This new Dead Space enhances the original in almost every way, using a Plasma Cutter to drop its ugliest appendages on the cutting room floor while preserving the essence of what made its distinctly dismemberment-heavy shooting so special, and grafting on welcome new character details in order to present its creepy sci-fi horror story in its very best light ‚Äì and its most intimidating shadows. </p>",

    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> Like many, I‚Äôve been waiting for a truly excellent Harry Potter game since I was in the third grade. In that time, we‚Äôve gotten some respectable&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/06/29/lego-harry-potter-years-1-4-review\">LEGO Potter games</a>, an underwhelming EA Sports Quidditch game for some reason, and even suffered through the fevered nightmare that is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ign.com/videos/harry-potter-for-kinect-launch-trailer\">Harry Potter Kinect</a>. But none of these has come close to fulfilling that fantasy of receiving a Hogwarts admission letter that opens the door to a secret world. With Hogwarts Legacy, I‚Äôm happy to say that we finally got a Harry Potter game that captures some of that magic. Its open world map absolutely nails the vibe of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, it has spellcasting combat that‚Äôs stupefyingly good, the characters that inhabit it are charming and unforgettable, and it is positively brimming with countless diversions to soak up dozens of hours of your time. It may not be the most impressive technical achievement and it is certainly cursed with a lack of enemy variety, but none of Hogwarts Legacy‚Äôs issues can cast a Descendo charm on this triumphant visit to the Wizarding World. </p>",

    "description": "It‚Äôs a thrill when we get to say this about a new piece of gaming hardware: The PlayStation VR 2 is a true generational leap that makes the old one look like a piece of junk. It‚Äôs not exactly cheap, but for $549.99 you get a high-end headset with a 4K, HDR-enabled OLED screen, a 110-degree field of view, built-in tracking cameras, and eye tracking, plus two of its slick Sense controllers with the excellent adaptive triggers and haptic feedback Sony introduced with the PlayStation 5‚Äôs DualSense controller. The catch is that it requires you to be connected to a PS5 by a single USB-C cable, but that means it‚Äôs much, much more powerful when it comes to delivering fantastic graphics than a self-contained headset like the Meta Quest 2. With all of that, including a few features you don‚Äôt see on even more expensive PC VR headsets like Valve‚Äôs Index and HP‚Äôs Reverb G2, the PlayStation VR2 has vaulted console VR into the lead in just about every category‚Ä¶ except available games.",

And now we‚Äôre back, in outer space‚Ä¶ okay, okay, don‚Äôt leave! I‚Äôll stop. The point is that with vastly expanded combat options, bigger, more open maps, vastly more abilities to play with, and enough collectable stuff to fill a Correllian freighter, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is in many ways the Batman: Arkham City to Fallen Order‚Äôs Arkham Asylum.

Even so, when I hit the start button on this 2023 remake of the legendary 2005 action-horror game I wasn‚Äôt prepared for how forcefully it would knock my knees out from under me and suplex me headfirst into 16 hours of sustained tension and exhilaration. This fully revitalised campaign dramatically one-ups the original in almost every conceivable way. Its Spanish countryside setting is substantially more sinister, its pacing has been tightened to the point where hardly a single minute is wasted, and its controls have been modernised in order to allow its signature dynamic shooting mechanics to really shine. I‚Äôve been waiting 18 years for a game to thrill me in the same way as Resident Evil 4; as it turns out, this whole time I‚Äôve just been waiting for another Resident Evil 4. </p>",
