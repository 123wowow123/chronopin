In this session we will discuss future improvements in Direct3D that will allow developers an unprecedented level of hardware control and reduced CPU rendering overhead across a broad ecosystem of hardware. If you use cutting-edge 3D graphics in your games, middleware, or engines and want to efficiently build rich and immersive visuals, you don't want to miss this talk. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> For nearly 20 years, DirectX has been the platform used by game developers to create the fastest, most visually impressive games on the planet.However, you asked us to do more. You asked us to bring you even closer to the metal and to do so on an unparalleled assortment of hardware. You also asked us for better tools so that you can squeeze every last drop of performance out of your PC, tablet, phone and console. Come learn our plans to deliver. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Driver overhead has been a frustrating reality for game developers for the entire life of the PC game industry. On desktop systems, driver overhead can decrease frame rate, while on mobile devices driver overhead is more insidious--robbing both battery life and frame rate. In this unprecedented sponsored session, Graham Sellers (AMD), Tim Foley (Intel), Cass Everitt (NVIDIA) and John McDonald (NVIDIA) will present high-level concepts available in today's OpenGL implementations that radically reduce driver overhead--by up to 10x or more. The techniques presented will apply to all major vendors and are suitable for use across multiple platforms. Additionally, they will demonstrate practical demos of the techniques in action in an extensible, open source comparison framework. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> When these changes are coming, how effective they'll be, or how widely-adopted they'll be all remains to be seen, but what we do know is that we'll know more once GDC 2014 comes around, so stay tuned! </p>",

In this unprecedented sponsored session, Graham Sellers (AMD), Tim Foley (Intel), Cass Everitt (NVIDIA) and John McDonald (NVIDIA) will present high-level concepts available in today's OpenGL implementations that radically reduce driver overhead--by up to 10x or more. The techniques presented will apply to all major vendors and are suitable for use across multiple platforms.

    "title": "Open-Air Fish Market Coming to San Diego",
    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> With a picturesque waterfront already in place, San Diego will soon have its very own open-air fish market reminiscent of other similar markets around the U.S., including Seattle’s Pike Place Market. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The plan, spearheaded by County Supervisor Greg Cox, was announced Wednesday. Cox said the Dockside Fish Market at the Downtown Waterfront will set up shop at the Fish Harbor Pier, near Tuna Harbor between the USS Midway Museum and Seaport Village. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> There, the pier will transform into an open-air fish market featuring pop-up canopies, tables and lots of fresh, local catches for sale. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The market will open to the public for the first time on Aug. 2, from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. After that, it will be held at that location every Saturday morning for the next year or so. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> For now, the plan is for fishing boats to pull into the harbor and unload their catches onto the pier, which could include fish, lobster, urchins, crab and whatever else they’ve caught in local waters. The fishermen will have to pay a vendor fee to be able to sell their goods at the market, but that dollar amount has not been set just yet. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Cox said the new seaside marketplace will not only give consumers a great deal on fresh fish, it will also bring business to local fishermen. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> There are still a number of commercial fisherman that are out there, they're working really hard, they're bringing their catch in on a daily basis, they're turning it over to fish markets at a wholesale price,\" said Cox. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> \"This will give them an opportunity to certainly get a higher price than they would at a wholesale fish market. But at the same time, it's going to be a great bargain for the citizens of San Diego. They will know that it's the freshest fish they can possibly get,\" he continued. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Zachary Roach is a partner for the open-air market and says his father, a commercial fisherman, has been catching rock crab for 20 years, yet the wholesale price hasn't changed. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> \"It hasn't fluctuated in giving him more money for the 20 years. But now we can, rather than sell wholesale, we can sell it here for a chunk of money and still be selling it for cheaper than what they would at retail or at a grocery store, so the consumer is getting the better rate too,” said Roach. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Employees of a nearby seafood market told NBC 7 they support the new open-air concept and hope the fishermen do well. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> As for locals and tourists, many say they’re looking forward to buying fresh seafood on the harbor. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> “I would totally support it – I think that’d be great to support local fishermen,” said San Diegan Brandi Skinner. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Gloria Simon, a tourist visiting from Utah, said she’d certainly check out the marketplace. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> “I think it’s a great idea because I love the Seattle Pike’s Market,” she told NBC 7. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Little Italy resident Sarah Johnson said the fish market will likely become one of her go-to shopping spots for seafood.“It’s convenient just to walk down here and get the fresh fish right off the market and bring it home. I would be a No.1 supporter of that, definitely,” said Johnson.A proposal to promote the market will be heard for the Board of Supervisors at a July 29 meeting. Meanwhile, Cox will continue to show his support for the open-air fish market in America’s Finest City. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> \"Seattle is famous for its Pike Place Fish Market,\" said Cox. \"There's no reason San Diego, with its vibrant waterfront, busy fishing fleets and great year-round weather, can't have our own open air fish market.\" </p>",

Offering an Xbox One without the Kinect sensor made financial sense in Microsoft's struggle against Sony, but it does not mean that people may never want to want to buy the Kinect at a later point. Until now though, there was no option to do so. Windows Phone Central has now learned that Microsoft is planning to sell the stand-alone Kinect sensor for $149 beginning on or around October 6. The timing is ideal as it leads well into the holiday season in the US and other countries, making the add-on an excellent gift for those who already own an Xbox One without the next-gen accessory.",

    "description": "When it comes to wireless charging, Nokia can certainly be credited with pushing the useful technology to the masses like no other. Now, in 2014 their next creation, now under Microsoft, is getting ready to grace our desks and countertops. The DT-903 smart wireless charging pad, which still maintains a terrible name, at least makes up for it in features. The DT-903 is unique enough to be called 'smart' and there's a good reason for the designation. We went hands on with the new DT-903 to show you what it is all about in our latest video. Featuring Qi wireless charging, NFC for 'tap-to-pair' and Bluetooth 4.0, the new Microsoft charger not only gives your Lumia power, but it tells you when you need to charge, or even if you have a missed call or text message.",

After Skyward Sword offered a slightly more linear, story-driven campaign than most fans were used to, Breath of the Wild readjusted dramatically in the opposite direction. Suddenly you could go anywhere and climb anything in any order you wanted, and goodness gracious was there a whole lot to choose from. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> There are plenty of fair criticisms to throw at Breath of the Wild, with common ones being its lack of traditional Zelda dungeons and items. But what’s truly impressive is how much it maintained the heart of a Zelda game even as it altered nearly every system around it. To a certain extent, Zelda has always been about exploration and choice, and Breath of the Wild simply leaned into and enabled those aspects of itself above all else, now making the world a place that would react to those choices as well. There’s just so much to see, so many people to meet and secrets to find hidden throughout this long-since devastated version of Hyrule. </p>",

With the Surface family, the Xbox, and peripherals, the company doesn’t shy away from building its own products and has established a sizeable fanbase who is interested in ‘what’s next’ for the company when it relates to these types of products. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> This past week, I was tipped off that the next generation Xbox was codenamed Scarlett and in an effort to track down if this information was accurate, I was able to view content that highlighted several unannounced Microsoft products that are coming in the next two years. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Microsoft is planning for the next Xbox console release to arrive in 2020. But what is more interesting, is that Microsoft describes ‘Scarlett’ as a family of devices; meaning we may see multiple pieces of hardware released that year. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> That date may seem relatively close considering that the Xbox One X launched last year but Microsoft is aggressively moving ahead with hardware in the console space to shake up the industry. But what we don’t know is if this is a brand new set of devices or simply a more ‘powerful’ Xbox One that is again, fully backward compatible with all the content available today. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Considering how much effort Microsoft has put into backward compatibility, I would expect the Scarlett devices to support current gen games but offer more advanced features and align possibly with Microsoft’s upcoming game-streaming services. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> As with any leak this far out, timing and plans can change but I was able to verify the information I viewed as being authentic and fully believe that the company is on-track to release the new console in two years. </p>",

A version with a bigger battery, the Zero+, will have a range of 85 miles (137km) thanks to a larger 8.3kWh pack—though this increases charging time to a still-reasonable six hours. </p>",

    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> Audi and Nvidia have&nbsp;announced&nbsp;they are working together to bring a fully self-driving car to the consumer market by the year 2020. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The announcement came on Wednesday at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada, as the two companies outlined their vision for a fully autonomous vehicle. German automaker Audi hopes to be one of the first automakers to achieve the feat, and is banking on U.S. graphics chipmaker Nvidia's artificial intelligence car computing platform, which uses deep learning to negotiate complex real-road conditions. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> To offer a taste of the results of their collaboration, Audi has been demoing its Q7 Piloted Driving Concept, which is fitted with Nvidia's Drive PX 2 processor. The companies claim that after four days of \"training\", equipped vehicles are able to drive themselves over a complex road course, thanks to the PX 2 chip's ability to learn on the fly without recourse to pre-mapped routes. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Audi and Nvidia have been working together for almost a decade, but the announcement at this year's CES is an indication of just how far the collaboration has come. Originally the partnership was limited to using Nvidia's graphics processors in Audi's virtual cockpit and navigation systems, but ambitions have since grown, and Audi said it will begin expanding its testing of the highly automated, artificial intelligence-equipped vehicles on public roads in California and select states in 2018. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> For Nvidia's part, the traditionally GPU-focused company has been working on autonomous vehicle systems for several years now and has rolled out development platforms and agreed partnerships with over 80 automakers and suppliers to realize its self-driving goals. In September the company introduced Xavier, a complete AI system on a chip for self-driving cars that's designed to meet international functional safety standards for in-car electronics. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Apple is thought to have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2016/10/17/apple-late-2017-deadline-self-driving-system/\">refocused its car project</a>&nbsp;recently.

    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> &nbsp;Apple today announced&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/mac/m1/\" target=\"_blank\">M1</a>, the most powerful chip it has ever created and the first chip designed specifically for the Mac. M1 is optimized for Mac systems in which small size and power efficiency are critically important. As a system on a chip (SoC), M1 combines numerous powerful technologies into a single chip, and features a unified memory architecture for dramatically improved performance and efficiency. M1 is the first personal computer chip built using cutting-edge 5-nanometer process technology and is packed with an astounding 16 billion transistors, the most Apple has ever put into a chip. It features the world’s fastest CPU core in low-power silicon, the world’s best CPU performance per watt, the world’s fastest integrated graphics in a personal computer, and breakthrough machine learning performance with the Apple Neural Engine. As a result, M1 delivers up to 3.5x faster CPU performance, up to 6x faster GPU performance, and up to 15x faster machine learning, all while enabling battery life up to 2x longer than previous-generation Macs.With its profound increase in performance and efficiency, M1 delivers the biggest leap ever for the Mac.1 </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> “There has never been a chip like M1, our breakthrough SoC for the Mac. It builds on more than a decade of designing industry-leading chips for iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, and ushers in a whole new era for the Mac,” said Johny Srouji, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Technologies. “When it comes to low-power silicon, M1 has the world’s fastest CPU core, the world’s fastest integrated graphics in a personal computer, and the amazing machine learning performance of the Apple Neural Engine. With its unique combination of remarkable performance, powerful features, and incredible efficiency, M1 is by far the best chip we’ve ever created.” </p><figure class=\"fig-img\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img   \" src=\"https://chronopin.blob.core.windows.net/thumb/9754f41c-66e7-4000-9550-8d4cc91025e9-chrono-lg.webp\" alt=\"M1 is the first personal computer chip built using cutting-edge 5-nanometer process technology and is packed with an astounding 16 billion transistors.\" height=\"551\" width=\"980\"><figcaption class=\"fig-cap\">M1 is the first personal computer chip built using cutting-edge 5-nanometer process technology and is packed with an astounding 16 billion transistors.</figcaption></figure><h2>First System on a Chip for the Mac</h2><p class=\"paragraph\"> Macs and PCs have traditionally used multiple chips for the CPU, I/O, security, and more. Now with M1, these technologies are combined into a single SoC, delivering a whole new level of integration for greater performance and power efficiency. M1 also features a unified memory architecture that brings together high-bandwidth, low-latency memory into a single pool within a custom package. This allows all of the technologies in the SoC to access the same data without copying it between multiple pools of memory, further improving performance and efficiency. </p><figure class=\"fig-img\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img   \" src=\"https://chronopin.blob.core.windows.net/thumb/826dc90a-683c-4ef2-8372-fabeee610862-chrono-lg.webp\" alt=\"CPU performance vs. power\" height=\"551\" width=\"980\"><figcaption class=\"fig-cap\">CPU performance vs. power</figcaption></figure><h2>The World’s Best CPU Performance per Watt</h2><p class=\"paragraph\"> M1 features an 8-core CPU consisting of four high-performance cores and four high-efficiency cores. Each of the high-performance cores provides industry-leading performance for single-threaded tasks, while running as efficiently as possible. They are the world’s fastest CPU cores in low-power silicon, allowing photographers to edit high-resolution photos with lightning speed and developers to build apps nearly 3x faster than before. And all four can be used together for a huge boost in multithreaded performance.&nbsp; </p><figure class=\"fig-img\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img   \" src=\"https://chronopin.blob.core.windows.net/thumb/e62b8f9b-96f6-41e2-931b-15c99c5af2cf-chrono-lg.webp\" alt=\"M1 chip features 8-core CPU\" height=\"551\" width=\"980\"><figcaption class=\"fig-cap\">M1 chip features 8-core CPU</figcaption></figure><p class=\"paragraph\"> The four high-efficiency cores deliver outstanding performance at a tenth of the power. By themselves, these four cores deliver similar performance as the current-generation, dual-core MacBook Air at much lower power. They are the most efficient way to run lightweight, everyday tasks like checking email or browsing the web, and preserve battery life like never before. And all eight cores can work together to provide incredible compute power for the most demanding tasks and deliver the world’s best CPU performance per watt. </p><figure class=\"fig-img\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img   \" src=\"https://chronopin.blob.core.windows.net/thumb/3fd23829-5262-496e-8ee6-922eb9e4ba3c-chrono-lg.webp\" alt=\"M1 includes an 8-core CPU delivering incredible compute power and the world’s best performance per watt.\" height=\"646\" width=\"980\"><figcaption class=\"fig-cap\">M1 includes an 8-core CPU delivering incredible compute power and the world’s best performance per watt.</figcaption></figure><h2>The World’s Fastest Integrated Graphics</h2><p class=\"paragraph\"> M1 includes Apple’s most advanced GPU. It benefits from years of analysis of Mac applications, including everyday apps and challenging pro workloads.

The 3,280-feet (1 kilometer) skyscraper is scheduled for&nbsp;<a href=\"http://kingdomtowerskyscraper.com/september-2015-update/\" target=\"_blank\">completion in 2020</a>. The Burj Khalifa, by comparison, stands at a meeker 2,716 feet, or 827 meters. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> “With this deal, we will reach new, as yet unheard of highs in real estate development, and will fulfill the company’s objective of creating a world-class urban center that offers an advanced lifestyle, so that Jeddah may have a new iconic landmark that attracts people from all walks of society with comprehensive services and a multitude of uses,” said Mounib Hammoud, Chief Executive Officer of Jeddah Economic Company. </p><h2>An architectural feat</h2><p class=\"paragraph\"> Previously dubbed Kingdom Tower, the building will boast 200 floors and overlook the Red Sea. Constructing it will require about 5.7 million square feet of concrete and 80,000 tons of steel,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentid=20140218196138\" target=\"_blank\">according to the Saudi Gazette</a>. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Building a structure that tall, particularly on the coast, where saltwater could potentially damage it, is no easy feat. The foundations, which will be 200 feet (60 meters) deep, need to be able to withstand the saltwater of the nearby ocean. As a result, Advanced Construction Technology Services will test the strength of different concretes. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Wind load is another issue for buildings of this magnitude. To counter this challenge, the tower will change shape regularly. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> “Because it changes shape every few floors, the wind loads go round the building and won’t be as extreme as on a really solid block,” Gordon Gill explained to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.constructionweekonline.com/article-13533-tall-order/1\" target=\"_blank\">Construction Weekly</a>. Gill is a partner at<a href=\"http://smithgill.com/\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture</a>, the design architects for the project. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Delivering the concrete to higher floors will also be a challenge. Possibly, engineers could use similar methods to those employed when building the Burj Khalifa; 6 million cubic feet of concrete was pushed through a single pump, usually at night when temperatures were low enough to ensure that it would set. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Though ambitious, building the Kingdom Tower should be feasible, according to Sang Dae Kim, the director of the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ctbuh.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Council on Tall Buildings</a>. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> “At this point in time we can build a tower that is one kilometer, maybe two kilometers. Any higher than that and we will have to do a lot of homework,” he told Construction Weekly. </p>",

The tower design was revised in 2019 with the height reduced to 499 meters.  </p><p class=\"paragraph\">  We are providing structural design services to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gensler.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Gensler</a>&nbsp;for the new tower and previously had for the original one.  </p><h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4><ul><li>The pile foundation built for the original tower is fully utilized by the new one.</li><li>The structural system for the new tower includes a concrete core, a mega frame composed of SRC mega columns and belt trusses and outrigger trusses linking the core and mega columns.</li><li>A hollow core with the cross-web walls removed realizes the architect’s vision of providing seven large atriums. Thickened solid slabs, working as rigid diaphragms, are provided at refuge levels to ensure the stability of the core.</li><li>A key design challenge originated from the substantial gravity and lateral loads—including wind and seismic—inherent in many supertall buildings. The sturdy foundation system, relying on concrete bored piles with post grouting, can support substantial gravity loads. The core-outrigger-mega frame system provides sufficient lateral stiffness and strength to resist significant lateral loads and satisfies the strict story drift ratio.</li><li>The tower features a unique crystal crown that resembles a four-petal yellow Osmanthus flower. The crown structure consists of eight mega columns at perimeter and the flange walls at center, supporting a helipad and a hanging structure for the tuned mass damper (TMD).</li><li>The top of the tower is designed to meet the H10 requirements of Japanese standards, which means only 10% of people can feel building motion during a 10-year wind event. Our creative solution combines two damping systems, a 300-ton TMD and a tuned sloshing damper (TSD) based on the 1000-ton water tank. This marks the first time this approach has been adopted for a supertall building.</li><li>The TMD is suspended by a unique structural device with multiple hanging masses that can swing in opposite directions, making it more efficient than a traditional single mass damper.</li></ul>",

    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\">    Webb often gets called the replacement for Hubble, but we prefer to call it a successor. After all, Webb is the scientific successor to Hubble; its science goals were motivated by results from Hubble. Hubble's science pushed us to look to longer wavelengths to \"go beyond\" what Hubble has already done. In particular, more distant objects are more highly redshifted, and their light is pushed from the UV and optical into the near-infrared. Thus observations of these distant objects (like the first galaxies formed in the Universe, for example) requires an infrared telescope. </p><div class=\"embed\"><iframe class=\"embed-youtube\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tnbSIbsF4t4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen ></iframe></div><p class=\"paragraph\">    This is the other reason that Webb is not a replacement for Hubble; its capabilities are not identical. Webb will primarily look at the Universe in the infrared, while Hubble studies it primarily at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths (though it has some infrared capability). Webb also has a much bigger mirror than Hubble. This larger light collecting area means that Webb can peer farther back into time than Hubble is capable of doing. Hubble is in a very close orbit around the earth, while Webb will be 1.5 million kilometers (km) away at the second Lagrange (L2) point.    </p><figure class=\"fig-img\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img   \" src=\"https://chronopin.blob.core.windows.net/thumb/79f07bbc-ae6f-481a-b14e-8a5d25cf9965-chrono-lg.webp\" alt=\"EM Spectrum and satellites\" height=\"232\" width=\"649\"><figcaption class=\"fig-cap\">EM Spectrum and satellites</figcaption></figure><h3>Wavelength</h3><p class=\"paragraph\">    Webb will observe primarily in the infrared and will have four science instruments to capture images and spectra of astronomical objects. These instruments will provide wavelength coverage from 0.6 to 28 micrometers (or \"microns\"; 1 micron is 1.0 x 10-6&nbsp;meters). The infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum goes from about 0.75 microns to a few hundred microns. This means that Webb's instruments will work primarily in the infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum, with some capability in the visible range (in particular in the red and up to the yellow part of the visible spectrum).    </p><p class=\"paragraph\">    The instruments on Hubble can observe a small portion of the infrared spectrum from 0.8 to 2.5 microns, but its primary capabilities are in the ultra-violet and visible parts of the spectrum from 0.1 to 0.8 microns.    </p><figure class=\"fig-img\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img   \" src=\"https://chronopin.blob.core.windows.net/thumb/2c8f1254-d587-4a4d-be9c-18ef6f9a39b7-chrono-lg.webp\" alt=\"Hubble's visible and infrared views of the Monkey Head Nebula.

Stars and planets that are just forming lie hidden behind cocoons of dust that absorb visible light. (The same is true for the very center of our galaxy.) However, infrared light emitted by these regions can penetrate this dusty shroud and reveal what is inside.    </p><p class=\"paragraph\">    At left are infrared and visible light images from the Hubble Space Telescope of the Monkey Head Nebula, a star-forming region. A jet of material from a newly forming star is visible in one of the pillars, just above and left of centre in the right-hand image.

The Hubble Space Telescope orbits around the Earth at an altitude of ~570 km above it. Webb will not actually orbit the Earth - instead it will sit at the Earth-Sun L2 Lagrange point, 1.5 million km away!    </p><figure class=\"fig-img\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img   \" src=\"https://chronopin.blob.core.windows.net/thumb/22554807-5348-4ae6-8250-3f94631f04a3-chrono-lg.webp\" alt=\"The Earth is 150 million km from the Sun\" height=\"112\" width=\"606\"><figcaption class=\"fig-cap\">The Earth is 150 million km from the Sun</figcaption></figure><figure class=\"fig-img\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img   \" src=\"https://chronopin.blob.core.windows.net/thumb/31386e4e-dd8a-4703-8c80-7297895ffd24-chrono-lg.webp\" alt=\"Webb will orbit the sun 1.5 million kilometers (1 million miles) away from the Earth at what is called the second Lagrange point or L2.

Webb will be launched on an Ariane 5 rocket and because it won't be in Earth orbit, it is not designed to be serviced by the space shuttle.    </p><figure class=\"fig-img\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img   \" src=\"https://chronopin.blob.core.windows.net/thumb/341523be-2451-4bfb-adbb-f7a0f4078769-chrono-lg.webp\" alt=\"Lagrange Points\" height=\"318\" width=\"477\"><figcaption class=\"fig-cap\">Lagrange Points</figcaption></figure><p class=\"paragraph\">    At the L2 point Webb's solar shield will block the light from the Sun, Earth, and Moon. This will help Webb stay cool, which is very important for an infrared telescope.    </p><p class=\"paragraph\">    As the Earth orbits the Sun, Webb will orbit with it - but stay fixed in the same spot with relation to the Earth and the Sun, as shown in the diagram to the left. Actually, satellites orbit around the L2 point, as you can see in the diagram - they don't stay completely motionless at a fixed spot.    </p><h3>How Far Will Webb See?</h3><figure class=\"fig-img\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img   \" src=\"https://chronopin.blob.core.windows.net/thumb/a70b41c9-b8d8-4e82-a62e-b6f28ab28178-chrono-lg.webp\" alt=\"Seeing back into the cosmos Credit: NASA and and Ann Feild [STScI]\" height=\"455\" width=\"576\"><figcaption class=\"fig-cap\">Seeing back into the cosmos Credit: NASA and and Ann Feild [STScI]</figcaption></figure><p class=\"paragraph\">    Because of the time it takes light to travel, the farther away an object is, the farther back in time we are looking.    </p><p class=\"paragraph\">    This illustration compares various telescopes and how far back they are able to see. Essentially, Hubble can see the equivalent of \"toddler galaxies\" and Webb Telescope will be able to see \"baby galaxies\". One reason Webb will be able to see the first galaxies is because it is an infrared telescope. The universe (and thus the galaxies in it) is expanding. When we talk about the most distant objects, Einstein's General Relativity actually comes into play. It tells us that the expansion of the universe means it is the space between objects that actually stretches, causing objects (galaxies) to move away from each other. Furthermore, any light in that space will also stretch, shifting that light's wavelength to longer wavelengths.

They all improve what came before them by conjuring up exciting new gameplay mechanics, developing characters through engaging stories, and switching up mission design to offer variety. In other words, they take a solid base and combine with new elements to create more advanced bonds, much like an alloy… or in this case, an Aloy. Horizon Forbidden West does this with aplomb, building on the already impressive foundations of 2017’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/20/horizon-zero-dawn-review\">Horizon Zero Dawn</a>&nbsp;to tell a thrilling story full of familiar explosive combat against elaborate robotic foes and blockbuster action sequences, but also adding Witcher-like settlements to the map and filling it out with great side quests. There’s a genuine sense of exploration and loads of completely involving lore behind it all to uncover. The result is a fantastic open-world action-adventure that, despite falling into a couple of its old habits, emphatically delivers on the promises made five years ago. </p>",

But more than anything else I was in near-constant awe – from the many absolutely jaw-dropping vistas, the sheer scope of an absolutely enormous world, the frequently harrowing enemies, and the way in which Elden Ring nearly always rewarded my curiosity with either an interesting encounter, a valuable reward, or something even greater. FromSoftware takes the ball that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review\">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>&nbsp;got rolling and runs with it, creating a fascinating and dense open world about freedom and exploration above all else, while also somehow managing to seamlessly weave a full-on Dark Souls game into the middle of it.

Some of it may initially seem like busywork to long-time GT players, but the racing events the Gran Turismo Café deliberately threads us through all make up part of the large list of career races we’d be otherwise doing anyhow – and the decent collection of reward cars offered for working through the menu books makes it well worth your time.  </p>",

But Gabe Nelson, Hivemapper’s head of operations, reckons the startup is reaching an inflection point that will lead to exponential scale.   </p><p class=\"paragraph\">   Hivemapper said Thursday it collected more than 1 million kilometers (about 620,000 miles) of unique street-level imagery. Compared to Google’s 60 million kilometers, that’s small potatoes. However, Hivemapper collected this data over the last three months.

    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> Like many of developer Supermassive’s previous games, The Quarry is clearly made both by and for people who love horror movies. From the start, it slowly builds tension and atmosphere, getting you invested by constantly asking you to make small decisions that will guide its teenage cast of potential murder victims. By the time the blood started flying, every choice felt like one more step in a rolling disaster, and that made it nearly impossible to put down. When I went back to replay it again, however, it was impossible to ignore just how non-interactive much of The Quarry actually is. As a spiritual sequel to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/24/until-dawn-review\">Until Dawn</a>, it's a better movie, but a worse game. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> You follow the story of nine camp counselors who get stuck in the woods for one more night at the end of the summer, with nothing to do but throw one last party before they go back to their lives. There's something stalking them from the treeline (because of course there is) and your choices determine which, if any, of the counselors will be able to survive the night. This setup layers three fairly textbook horror plots on top of each other as you progress, but you can tell that Supermassive Games had a lot of fun figuring out how to connect them together. When you play, you may think you're in one type of horror movie, but you're often in another. </p>",

    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> Growing up as a child of the 90s, whenever I stepped into an arcade, I’d always do a walk around to see what they had before putting my quarters into any machines. This usually didn’t last very long because as soon as I saw a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cabinet, I’d shout to my friends “They got Turtles!” and we’d rush on over. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> It’s abundantly clear that the developers at Tribute Games share a similar love for the 90s TMNT beat-em-ups. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge is nothing but unwaveringly reverent to the classic 1989 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Arcade game, and more prominently, 1991’s Turtles in Time. Best of all, it transforms the arcadey quarter-munching design of combat into something much more skill forward while still maintaining the same button mashy appeal. Put simply, Shredder’s Revenge is a prime example of how to breathe new life into a classic arcade beat-em-up. </p>",

    "title": "Improved Bowflex SelectTech 1090i dumbbell lets you select the weight with the turn of a dial",
    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\">     The old Bowflex 1090 dumbbells were discontinued and in their place stand this 1090i version with some subtle changes to design and features, including a new hand grip that has a soft rubber coating. This is a much more comfortable piece of kit to have at home, especially when compared to the hash metal offering of the Amazon Basics Adjustable Dumbbells. &nbsp;     </p><p class=\"paragraph\">     These have a super sleek premium design, featuring an all-black cradle and weight plates with a hint of chrome in the handle. The deep red Bowflex strip at the top is a nice design touch.

    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> At first glance, Two Rock, Arizona is merely a backwater town occupied by little more than tumbleweed and a few rows of houses. But very little is as it first appears, and all it takes to reveal As Dusk Falls’ many layers of storytelling depth is one small,&nbsp;decades-spanning&nbsp;tragedy. And it’s all about the story, since this is a choose-your-own-adventure-style graphic novel that cleverly pulls ideas from games like Telltale’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/12/12/the-walking-dead-the-game-review\">The Walking Dead</a>&nbsp;series and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/13-sentinels-aegis-rim-review\">13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim</a>. Each member of this voice-acting cast of unique and interesting characters has their own, often conflicting emotional stakes that accelerate the story in seemingly hundreds of logical and intelligently connected directions. Through the powerful and often far-reaching consequences of your own actions, this small town is gradually unveiled as a powder keg full of secrets, vices, and familial bonds that run far deeper than any outsider is initially led to expect. </p>",

The concept of putting you in the paws of an average cat may be a silly one on the surface, but Stray uses that furry vehicle to tell a genuinely compelling story with some entertaining action along the way.

Of course, while this third entry evolves in some key areas that make the epic journey more consistently fun than the two mainline games that came before it, it also repeats some of the same mistakes, including sloppy writing, weak bosses, and graphics that often leave something to be desired. Even so, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is already competing for the spot as my favorite iteration of this beloved series. </p>",

Splatoon 3’s campaign — dubbed The Return of the Mammalians — starts in territory so familiar that I was initially worried I was about to spend the next several hours slogging through tutorials on fundamentals I’d learned two games ago. Thankfully, the rug was quickly pulled out from under me, leading to a brand-new take on the series’ hub world design mixed with some of the best ideas of Splatoon 2’s Octo Expansion. Splatoon 3 boldly let me decide on whether or not to blaze my own path toward any of its 70 bite-sized, inventive missions, and choose where to go next when exploring its fuzzy ooze-filled world. A lot of the enemies I found there were unchanged from previous Splatoons, but I had a great time navigating the large variety of objectives all the way to the campaign’s explosively satisfying finale. </p>",

    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> Apple in September 2022 introduced the Apple Watch Ultra, a high-end version of the Apple Watch that's been in development for years now. Designed to compete with more expensive fitness-focused smart watches from companies like Garmin, the Apple Watch Ultra is aimed at&nbsp;sports enthusiasts and athletes&nbsp;that need more battery life and more sport-specific performance from of their devices. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Apple says the Apple Watch Ultra was&nbsp;built for endurance, exploration, and adventure, and it is the&nbsp;largest Apple Watch to date at 49mm, which is 4mm larger than the 45mm Apple Watch Series 8 that it's being sold alongside. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The Apple Watch Ultra features&nbsp;the first redesign we've seen in years&nbsp;with a lightweight&nbsp;aerospace-grade titanium body,&nbsp;flat sapphire crystal face, a&nbsp;larger diameter and deeper grooved Digital Crown, a&nbsp;housing for the side button&nbsp;and an&nbsp;extra physical button on the left side&nbsp;called the Action button. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> At&nbsp;up to 2000 nits, the Apple Watch Ultra is the&nbsp;brightest Apple Watch&nbsp;to date, so it is easy to see in sunlight. The Action button is designed in&nbsp;international orange&nbsp;to make it noticeable in the dark and under water, and it's customizable so it can activate Workouts, mark segments, set Compass Waypoints, and more. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> There are&nbsp;three built-in microphones&nbsp;to improve sound quality, and a beamforming algorithm captures voice while reducing ambient background sounds even when it's noisy outdoors. There is an&nbsp;86-decibel siren&nbsp;available for drawing help if needed, with two SOS patterns. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> With the larger 49mm casing, Apple was able to include a larger battery. The Apple Watch Ultra&nbsp;lasts for up to 36 hours&nbsp;on a single charge, and with a&nbsp;new low-power setting, battery life can last for up to&nbsp;60 hours&nbsp;for multi-day adventuring. The battery lasts long enough for users to complete a long-course triathlon that includes a 2.4 mile swim, 112-mile bike ride, and a full 26.2-mile marathon. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The Apple Watch Ultra features&nbsp;dual-frequency GPS, integrating both the&nbsp;L1 and L5 frequencies, plus it has new positioning algorithms. It provides the most accurate GPS of any Apple Watch, which means it also offers precise distance, pace, and route data for training and competing. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> To accommodate more extreme environments, the Apple Watch Ultra can withstand a&nbsp;wider temperature range. It works in conditions as cold as -4 degrees Fahrenheit (-20° C) to as hot as 131 degrees Fahrenheit (55° C). The watch is&nbsp;certified to MIL-STD-810H, a metric used for military equipment and by rugged equipment manufacturers. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> For water sports, the Apple Watch Ultra can hold up to&nbsp;kitesurfing, wakeboarding, and recreational scuba diving, activities not recommended for the standard Apple Watch models. The Apple Watch Ultra is&nbsp;certified to WR100 and EN 13319, an internationally recognized standard for diving accessories. When used for diving, the Apple Watch Ultra has a&nbsp;depth gauge&nbsp;and a dedicated&nbsp;Depth app&nbsp;that displays current depth, water temperature (using the new temperature sensor), duration under water, and max depth reached. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Apple designed a special&nbsp;Wayfinder watch face&nbsp;for the Apple Watch Ultra, with a built-in compass and space for up to eight complications. The watch face can be customized for the mountain, ocean, or trail, and it turns red at night for better visibility. The Apple Watch Ultra supports&nbsp;Compass Waypoints&nbsp;for marking a location or point of interest, and a&nbsp;Backtrack&nbsp;feature uses GPS to create a path showing where the user has been, helpful for retracing steps when lost. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> In addition to features designed for exploring and adventuring, the Apple Watch Ultra has&nbsp;all of the functionality available in the Apple Watch Series 8. It monitors heart rate, tracks sleep, can take ECG readings, monitors blood oxygen, and offers all of the same fitness tracking options. All Apple Watch Ultra models&nbsp;feature cellular connectivity, with a cellular plan needed to access all functions. </p><figure class=\"fig-img\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img   \" src=\"https://chronopin.blob.core.windows.net/thumb/11368b39-9fe0-4168-8837-7b27519f6b5f-chrono-lg.webp\" alt=\"Apple Watch Ultra\" height=\"501\" width=\"1000\"><figcaption class=\"fig-cap\">Apple Watch Ultra</figcaption></figure><p class=\"paragraph\"> The Apple Watch Ultra has the same&nbsp;temperature sensor&nbsp;that's in the Series 8, which measures water temperature but is also used for&nbsp;fertility planning for women. It improves cycle tracking and can give retrospective ovulation estimates. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> There are motion sensors in the Apple Watch Ultra that enable&nbsp;Crash Detection, alerting emergency services if you are in a severe car crash. When a crash is detected, the Apple Watch checks in with the user and then dials emergency services automatically if there's no response after a 10 second countdown. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> There are three new&nbsp;sport-focused bands&nbsp;available for the Apple Watch Ultra, including the&nbsp;Trail Loop,&nbsp;Alpine Loop, and&nbsp;Ocean Band, plus older bands designed for 44 and 45mm Apple Watches fit the new model. The Trail Loop band is the thinnest Apple Watch band to date, while the Alpine Loop features high-strength yarn and a woven design made for durability. The Ocean Band is for extreme water sports and features a flexible fluoroelastomer that can stretch to fit over a wetsuit. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> <chronodollar class=\"chrono-dollar-highlight\">$AAPL</chronodollar> </p>",

Ada’s efficiency has increased dramatically because of this huge feature boost; it now provides double the performance of Ampere. More than that, Ada has better scalability and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tech4gamers.com/overclocking/\">overclocking</a>&nbsp;per watt given than any prior generation. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The GPUs of the 40 series is the newest generation and have updated Ray Tracing with Tensor cores. NVIDIA has used its third-generation Ray Tracing cores, improving their stellar performance. The RT-TFLOP performance of these next-gen RT cores is enhanced by up to 2.8 times due to their increased ray-triangle intersection throughput. The GeForce RTX 4090 will have 191 RT-TFLOPS, much more than the fastest GPU of the last generation, which only had 78 RT-TFLOPS. This will make it easy to render immersive ray-traced environments quickly. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> NVIDIA’s newest iteration of Tensor cores has also been added to Ada. Superfast 8-bit floating-point tensor engines are at the heart of these new cores. The GeForce RTX 4090 delivers 1.32 petaFLOPS. Therefore, this increases throughput by a factor of up to five.

    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> Like a sugar-crazed child working their way to the bottom of a Halloween bag full of treats, A Plague Tale: Requiem is confident that the things which made the first game great will be even more delectable in ludicrous quantities. You liked massive swarms of rats? Well, how about we increase the number of them by a degree of 1,000! You enjoyed a gruesome and harrowing journey that tested the limits of your emotional resilience? Great, let’s increase your personal suffering by 200%! This follow-up to one of my favorite action-adventure games of the previous console generation turns the dials up to 11 in practically every way, and overwhelmingly benefits from those escalations despite sometimes being a bit heavy on the nihilism. With improved stealth action mechanics, a fantastic (and deeply depressing) story, and graphics that had me gawking, A Plague Tale: Requiem is an impressive glow up that’s easily worth the immense horrors it subjected me to. </p>",

    "title": "Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope Review - IGN",
    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> When a game hits on a good idea, some developers are content to play it safe for the sequel, making a few refinements but largely stick to what worked the first time. That totally makes sense. But Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope is not that kind of sequel; even though&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/28/mario-rabbids-kingdom-battle-review\">Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle</a>&nbsp;surprised us all with its smart&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/24/xcom-2-war-of-the-chosen-review\">XCOM</a>-style tactics in Nintendo clothing, this followup maintains its best ideas but reinvents itself to the point where it immediately feels very different. It’s bigger and better in nearly every way, with a more freeform and customizable take on combat and an almost completely rethought overworld that’s much less linear and absolutely packed with puzzles. The story’s all over the place and the Switch can’t always handle everything smoothly, but it’s a fantastic game that can be played as either an enjoyable cakewalk or a deep, demanding tactical challenge, all while maintaining its zany sense of humor. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Picking back up in the post-Rabbid invasion Mushroom Kingdom, things immediately get even weirder when a giant manta ray from space arrives to cause trouble. The story is actually one of Sparks of Hope’s few missteps: the original’s trans-dimensional blending of Mario characters and goofball Rabbids is completely absurd, but it kind of makes sense in its own way. This time, though, the completely unrelated enemy spreads what’s effectively Ganon’s corrupt ooze with eyeballs from Breath of the Wild everywhere, and most but not all of her minions are also Rabbids for some reason? Also we have a spaceship for traveling between literal worlds? It makes Kingdom Battle look grounded in reality by comparison, which is something I never thought I’d say about that game. I wasn’t expecting deep lore or anything, but it’s kind of a mess. It does consistently have some pretty good jokes, though, so at least I was chuckling as I was scratching my head. </p>",

It’s just incredible to look at, feels equally amazing to play, and is jam packed with opportunities for style and creativity thanks to the wide assortment of wild weapons at your disposal. Bayonetta 3 just further cements its legacy, strutting out with a surprising sequel in that it actually takes a lot of risks with changing up its established formula in an effort to revitalize a combat system that only slightly evolved between the first two games. Fortunately those risks pay off. Bayonetta 3 is an invigorated sequel with fresh new ideas that embolden its 13-year-old combat system, an impressive amount of variety throughout its 10 to 12-hour campaign, and more of that trademark sexy Bayonetta style that makes the series one of a kind. </p>",

This is&nbsp;the&nbsp;Call of Duty experience, deconstructed, reconsidered, and obsessively optimized over 15 uninterrupted years of iteration. I know when I'm playing a Black Ops game because it has offbeat arcade modes and the latest iteration of Nuketown. I know I'm playing a Modern Warfare game because the shooting is so finely tuned that I want to take my Gunsmith build out to dinner. Infinity Ward has officially mastered the instant gratification of aiming down sights and deleting targets. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> That goes a long way, though some of Modern Warfare 2's biggest swings, such as revamped progression and a genre-bending campaign, are less elegant. It also suffers from an obtuse UI, fits of crashes, weird bugs, and the unexplained absence of basic features like stat tracking. But altogether, it's a good year for Call of Duty. </p>",

Sony Santa Monica finds itself in a situation not dissimilar to when Francis Ford Coppola created the sequel to his mob movie masterpiece, The Godfather. Like part two of the Corleone story, God of War Ragnarok puts a fierce, younger member of the family directly under the microscope. In doing so it manages to reach the heights of its predecessor and, in some ways, even tower above it. The writing, performances, and music are each exceptional, bringing this expansive Norse tapestry to life – but even as it holds your heart in one hand with its elegantly told story it’s crunching bones in the other with fantastically ferocious combat. It all binds together to forge a monumental action epic that adds yet another impressive landmark to the video game landscape. </p>",

Sherry asks Cid to be friends before they consider dating, though Cid has completely forgotten who Sherry is and decides to just avoid her.

An election is announced to fill an empty student council seat. Gaunt Knight erects an anti-magic barrier, allowing the fake Shadow Garden to capture the academy.

    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> It is still unbelievable to me that after 26 years of linear, straightforward RPGs, developer Game Freak really looked Pokémon players dead in the eye and said, “It’s fine, go wherever you want.” In the lead-up to the launch of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, I thought this claim would end up being a marketing gimmick, a little joke, something we’d all be mad about later. But from the moment I left the hallowed halls of Uva Academy, that promise has been wonderfully fulfilled, with open-world, open-ended gameplay serving as a shining beacon for the future of this beloved franchise. And yet, a finger on the cursed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-scarlet-violet/Mankey\">Mankey</a>’s paw has curled anyway – Scarlet and Violet’s wonderfully innovative design is dramatically undermined by the numerous ways in which they feel deeply unfinished, with issues ranging from an incomplete world to massive and ubiquitous technical problems. So even though I want to celebrate how this generation reinvents and reinvigorates the world of Pokémon, I can’t without putting a great big warning label on it. </p>",

This spiritual successor to the sci-fi survival horror series recreates the haunting blood-streaked hallways and space zombie-slaying hallmarks first established on the USG Ishimura back in 2008, and injects the gore with more awe than ever before thanks to some strikingly detailed splashes of blood and guts. Unfortunately, while the mutant dismemberment has never been more vivid, The Callisto Protocol’s shortcomings appear just as clearly. Occasional control annoyances, imbalanced combat, and a general absence of innovation result in a roughly eight-hour massacre that’s gratifyingly gruesome, but never quite as great as the series that inspired it. </p>",

    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> One of my favorite things about watching superheroes duke it out is when someone gets smacked so hard they fly backwards and crash through solid walls, explode tanker trucks, or slam into their friends. It’s an awesome demonstration of just how strong these godlike characters are supposed to be, and it’s always a disappointment when a superhero game doesn’t quite capture that feeling. With Marvel’s Midnight Suns, however, Firaxis has built a deep and innovative turn-based tactical combat system around the joy of having Iron Man, Dr. Strange, Blade, and more knock enemies around like toys they're trying to break – and that hasn’t gotten old in the roughly 75 hours of its surprisingly expansive RPG campaign. A lot of that time isn’t spent in battles, though, and while it’s certainly appealing to get up close and personal with this cast of more than a dozen popular and lesser-known Marvel heroes, it does tend to go a bit overboard with convincing Earth’s mightiest heroes to all be your BFFs. </p>",

    "title": "The French government-owned railway, SNCF's project “drone trains” plans to put driverless trains on tracks by 2023.",
    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> The French government-owned railway,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.sncf.com/en/passengers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">SNCF,</a>&nbsp;has a project called “drone trains” and it is really exciting. They want their fast trains to be driverless and they are working hard to get it done. The first prototype of driverless trains is pitched to be on the tracks by 219. The first experiment will be for hauling cargo and if all goes well, the driverless trains will be taking passengers shortly after. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The special driverless trains will look by-and-large like ordinary trains but they’ll be fitted with external sensors to replace the conductor! The sensors look out for obstacles and if they do notice something automatic braking is applied. Don’t panic, this isn’t going to be like a sense from Unstoppable.

    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\">    In an effort to combat the devastating drought conditions hitting California, the Golden State will become the first in the nation to install solar panel canopies over canals.    </p><p class=\"paragraph\">    The $20 million pilot project funded by the state has been dubbed \"<a href=\"https://www.tid.org/about-tid/current-projects/project-nexus/\" target=\"_blank\">Project Nexus</a>.\" It will consist of an estimated 8,500 feet of solar panels installed over three sections of Turlock Irrigation District (TID) canals in Central California. The installation process is expected to begin by 2023, and be completed by 2024.    </p><p class=\"paragraph\">    The project, first announced in February, was initiated by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://solaraquagrid.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Solar AquaGrid</a>&nbsp;— a Bay Area development firm focused on innovative solutions to address water and energy issues. They have partnered with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.citizengroup.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Citizen Group</a>&nbsp;organization and TID to kick-start Project Nexus.&nbsp; &nbsp;    </p><p class=\"paragraph\">    According to TID, the project aims to use water and energy management hand-in-hand. The project is designed to increase renewable power generation, while reducing water evaporation and vegetative growth in canals.    </p><p class=\"paragraph\">    TID states that the project will also serve as a \"proof of concept\" to further study \"solar over canal design.\" The agency cites a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://escholarship.org/content/qt8cj5j07p/qt8cj5j07p.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2021 University of California, Merced study</a>, which showed that covering all of the approximately 4,000 miles of public water delivery system infrastructure in the state with solar panels could save an estimated 63 billion gallons of water annually, as well as&nbsp; result in significant energy and cost savings.&nbsp;    </p><p class=\"paragraph\">    \"According to the study, the 13 gigawatts of solar power the panels would generate each year would equal about one-sixth of the state's current installed capacity,\" TID wrote on its website.&nbsp;    </p>",

Priced at $199, the Peephole Cam failed to catch on, leading Ring to discontinue it in 2021. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> But now, Ring’s giving it another go — the Peephole Cam made a return this morning at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/ces/\">CES 2023</a>. The model is the same but now starts at $129 and ships with software that brings its capabilities in line with the rest of Ring’s product portfolio. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> “After removing the Peephole Cam from our inventory, we heard from a number of customers who still were interested in this device and wanted to secure their front door with a Ring Doorbell but were not able to install one of Ring’s existing doorbells,” Ring CTO Josh Roth told TechCrunch in an email interview. “We are pleased to be able to offer the Ring Peephole Cam at a lower price than before to better serve our customers.” </p><figure class=\"fig-img\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img   \" src=\"https://chronopin.blob.core.windows.net/thumb/ac7a52e0-c608-4f57-8e3e-51576fc9f398-chrono-lg.webp\" alt=\"Ring brings back the Peephole Cam\" height=\"1000\" width=\"1000\"><figcaption class=\"fig-cap\">Ring brings back the Peephole Cam</figcaption></figure><p class=\"paragraph\"> The Peephole Cam — which Ring insists can be installed without permanent modifications to a door — offers motion detection, a doorbell button, 1080p video, two-way talk, real-time streaming video and Privacy Zones (areas users can designate to black out from their camera’s field of view). Exclusive to the Peephole Cam is an adjustable impact sensor to detect when a door is being “physically interacted with”; when the Peephole Cam senses vibrations, it’ll alert that someone’s knocking on the door and will begin recording. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Predictably, the Peephole Cam works with Alexa, letting owners send announcements or sound effects to Alexa-enabled devices when a knock, motion or doorbell ring is detected. A Peephole Cam-detected knock or motion can also be set to trigger smart home routines — for example, switching on connected lights and closing motorized window blinds. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> When asked about the Peephole Cam’s privacy features, Roth noted that the doorbell has built-in cover slides to prevent a passerby from looking through the peephole and a toggle for audio recording.

    "title": "The real reason 7,000 nurses in New York City have gone on strike",
    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> More than 7,000 nurses in New York City&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/09/nyregion/nurses-strike-nyc-hospitals.html\">are on strike</a>&nbsp;after failing to agree on a new contract with the hospitals where they work, leading two hospital systems in the city to cancel elective surgeries, ask ambulances to divert patients to other hospitals, and bringing in traveling nurses to maintain operations. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The strike was very nearly a much bigger crisis: Nurses at eight other city hospitals reached a last-minute deal with their management. It is still perhaps the most high-profile example of the tension between hospital executives and their medical staff that has been magnified by the pandemic. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The past few years have made clear the degree to which American hospitals rely on nurses to handle a surge of patients in a public health crisis and the struggles of the same health system to appropriately value that nursing work. While the strike in NYC involves only four facilities, it’s a symptom of a structural failure in US health care: Hospitals do not have a strong financial incentive to invest in their nursing staffs. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Strikes by nurses and medical staff have occurred frequently in recent years.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSOeiQr6b-U2PHFysZDcGUC-exORyHaZ3XfQAE_bOiVOeu1uKxPedu7AS36nWXkfw/pubhtml#\">Eight of the 25 major work stoppages</a>&nbsp;involving 1,000 workers or more that the US Labor Department tracked in 2022 were initiated by health care workers, the highest share of any single profession. There have been dozens of smaller walkouts by nurses in the past few years. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Labor shortages have left nurses overworked and insisting on more help in contract negotiations. There are more than 700 positions currently open at the three Montefiore hospitals in the Bronx where nurses are striking, the New York Times&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/09/nyregion/nurses-strike-nyc-hospitals.html\">reported</a>. The nurses have said that management’s current offers on compensation and, in particular, hiring more staff to relieve overburdened nurses are not sufficient. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Montefiore says it has offered to raise wages for existing workers and to hire about 150 new nursing positions. Mount Sinai, the other hospital where nurses are on strike, has 500 open positions, according to the Times. According to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hellgatenyc.com/why-thousands-of-nyc-nurses-are-preparing-to-strike-montefiore\">Hell Gate NYC</a>, nurses at Montefiore have said they are responsible for as many as 35 different patients on their own on a given day. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The experts I’ve spoken with over the past few years generally agree that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23076581/us-covid-health-care-nurses-pay-salary\">nurses are tremendously undervalued</a>&nbsp;given the importance of their work in delivering quality health care. Research has found repeatedly that more nursing staff leads to patients reporting a better experience in the hospital and better health outcomes. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> But the problem is, given the way health care in the US is typically paid for, hiring more nurses and making their work environment better doesn’t necessarily make good economic sense for these hospitals. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> “There is a lot said about ‘greedy’ health systems,” Betty Rambur, professor of nursing at the University of Rhode Island, said. “But they are just responding to the financial incentives in the current reimbursement model.” </p><h3>The structural flaw in US health care behind the NYC nurses strike</h3><p class=\"paragraph\"> Nurses point to exorbitant executive compensation (which&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2021/06/14/health-care-ceo-pay-2020-pandemic\">soared nationwide</a>&nbsp;during the pandemic) and multimillion-dollar real estate deals to explain their decision to strike. They have a point: Hospitals behaving on pure altruism would spend more on clinical staff without their nurses needing to go on strike to force their hand. </p><figure class=\"fig-img\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img   \" src=\"https://chronopin.blob.core.windows.net/thumb/0d0e4010-8ee9-41c1-a27e-b75a8a0afb0b-chrono-lg.webp\" alt=\"Nurses shout slogans during a rally outside Mount Sinai Hospital on January 10.\" height=\"613\" width=\"920\"><figcaption class=\"fig-cap\">Nurses shout slogans during a rally outside Mount Sinai Hospital on January 10.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"paragraph\"> But these hospitals are also responding to the financial incentives established in the ways the United States pays for health care. Slashing executive pay (Montefiore’s CEO makes $6 million a year) can only pay for so many new nursing positions. Canceling a $38 million land deal in White Plains would make more money available, but when revenue depends on the number of services that a hospital system provides, buying land and building new facilities does make fiscal sense. Those new outposts should be a permanent source of new revenue once they are built, staffed, and operational. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Therein lies the problem. Under the fee-for-service model that still dominates American health care, where every physician service can be billed by the hospital where they work, hospitals have every incentive to expand their services but little incentive to hire more nurses to support that work. From a hospital’s accounting perspective, nurses are entirely a cost. They do not generate any revenue directly, even though they are necessary to providing quality medical care. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> A physician can perform exams and surgeries, order tests, and prescribe medication — all services that can be billed individually. A nurse’s work is essential to those services,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23076581/us-covid-health-care-nurses-pay-salary\">as I reported last summe</a>r, but their labor is not accounted for directly. Instead, the cost of employing nurses is rolled up in the same “room charge” that covers the Jell-O a patient might receive in their room. No matter how many services a nurse performs and how vital they are to making sure patients have a good experience, they do not generate any additional revenue for their hospitals under the current fee-for-service system. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> That means American hospitals have a strong financial motivation to keep their nursing staffs as trim as possible, which has contributed to the burnout and exhaustion nurses have reported over the past few years. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> New York’s state government attempted to address staffing issues with a 2021 law that established new committees at all hospitals, populated by both nurses and management, that would set acceptable staffing levels for their patient care units. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> However, as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nysfocus.com/2023/01/05/nurse-safe-staffing-ratios-strike/\">New York Focus and City &amp; State</a>&nbsp;jointly reported earlier this year, the committee process&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nysfocus.com/2023/01/05/nurse-safe-staffing-ratios-strike/\">has often been derailed</a>&nbsp;by disagreements between the two sides. Management at various facilities has ignored the input of nurses and imposed their own nurse-to-patient ratios. Nurses have complained to state regulators but enforcement actions have not yet been taken by an understaffed state health department, and it is unclear if they ever will be, the news outlets reported. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> And even that plan did not change the underlying economics of most hospitals’ business models. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> “What we forget is when hospitals put profits over patients, they are operating well within the system of economic carrots and sticks that we created for them, and within the system we created, hospitals are acting completely rationally as any other economic agent would,” Olga Yakusheva, a health care economist at the University of Michigan, said. “There is no economic incentive, right now, for hospitals to invest in adequate nurse staffing, pay nurses well, or provide a good working environment for nurses.” </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Until the US gives hospitals good financial reasons to invest in their nursing staffs, these labor disputes are going to occur again and again. As much as we want our health system to be focused on quality health care, in America, health care is a business. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Good health care and profitable health care are not always the same thing. The failure to value nursing in the way we pay for medical services, which laid the groundwork for NYC’s nurses strike, is a stark example of that. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> <chronohash class=\"chrono-hash-highlight\">#Strike</chronohash> </p>",

    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> After several components from Italian die casting machinery maker IDRA Group were spotted at Tesla's Gigafactory Austin over the past few months, it looks like technicians finally started assembling the 9,000-ton Giga Press that will be used to churn out Cybertruck structural components. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Drone operator Joe Tegtmeyer, who has been following closely the construction of Tesla's Texas plant since groundbreaking, has spotted the giant new casting machine being assembled inside the factory. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The drone flyover video clearly shows that Tesla is currently assembling the Giga Press, the world's largest aluminum die casting machine.

    "title": "A remake of Electronic Arts' 15-year-old sci-fi survival horror classic, Dead Space aims to retain the terrifying atmosphere, gore-soaked action and tense, twisty storytelling",
    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> Never mind the numerous necromorphs, the tortured torsos sprouting out of walls, or the terrifyingly towering space sphincter – the thing I was most scared of going into the Dead Space remake is that it wouldn't live up to my fond memories of the fantastically horrific 2008 original. After just over 12 hours spent stalking through the revitalized USG Ishimura I’m happy to report that of the many things to legitimately fear about this haunted space hulk, that was not one of them. This new Dead Space enhances the original in almost every way, using a Plasma Cutter to drop its ugliest appendages on the cutting room floor while preserving the essence of what made its distinctly dismemberment-heavy shooting so special, and grafting on welcome new character details in order to present its creepy sci-fi horror story in its very best light – and its most intimidating shadows. </p>",

    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> Like many, I’ve been waiting for a truly excellent Harry Potter game since I was in the third grade. In that time, we’ve gotten some respectable&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/06/29/lego-harry-potter-years-1-4-review\">LEGO Potter games</a>, an underwhelming EA Sports Quidditch game for some reason, and even suffered through the fevered nightmare that is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ign.com/videos/harry-potter-for-kinect-launch-trailer\">Harry Potter Kinect</a>. But none of these has come close to fulfilling that fantasy of receiving a Hogwarts admission letter that opens the door to a secret world. With Hogwarts Legacy, I’m happy to say that we finally got a Harry Potter game that captures some of that magic. Its open world map absolutely nails the vibe of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, it has spellcasting combat that’s stupefyingly good, the characters that inhabit it are charming and unforgettable, and it is positively brimming with countless diversions to soak up dozens of hours of your time. It may not be the most impressive technical achievement and it is certainly cursed with a lack of enemy variety, but none of Hogwarts Legacy’s issues can cast a Descendo charm on this triumphant visit to the Wizarding World. </p>",

    "title": "Everything else about the PS VR2 feels like a quantum leap over any other headset in its price class",
    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\">   It’s a thrill when we get to say this about a new piece of gaming hardware: The PlayStation VR 2 is a true generational leap that makes the old one look like a piece of junk. It’s not exactly cheap, but for $549.99 you get a high-end headset with a 4K, HDR-enabled OLED screen, a 110-degree field of view, built-in tracking cameras, and eye tracking, plus two of its slick Sense controllers with the excellent adaptive triggers and haptic feedback Sony introduced with the PlayStation 5’s DualSense controller. The catch is that it requires you to be connected to a PS5 by a single USB-C cable, but that means it’s much, much more powerful when it comes to delivering fantastic graphics than a self-contained headset like the Meta Quest 2.

    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> At first I was afraid, I was petrified – I kept thinking \"how could Respawn follow up on its outstanding Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order?\" But then I spent so many nights playing the sequel finding out how they got it right and Cal Kestis grew strong, and I learned how to get along. And now we’re back, in outer space… okay, okay, don’t leave! I’ll stop. The point is that with vastly expanded combat options, bigger, more open maps, vastly more abilities to play with, and enough collectable stuff to fill a Correllian freighter, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is in many ways the Batman: Arkham City to Fallen Order’s Arkham Asylum. And much like the Arkham games did for Batman, nothing else convincingly captures playing as a Force user quite as well as this. </p>",

Even so, when I hit the start button on this 2023 remake of the legendary 2005 action-horror game I wasn’t prepared for how forcefully it would knock my knees out from under me and suplex me headfirst into 16 hours of sustained tension and exhilaration. This fully revitalised campaign dramatically one-ups the original in almost every conceivable way. Its Spanish countryside setting is substantially more sinister, its pacing has been tightened to the point where hardly a single minute is wasted, and its controls have been modernised in order to allow its signature dynamic shooting mechanics to really shine. I’ve been waiting 18 years for a game to thrill me in the same way as Resident Evil 4; as it turns out, this whole time I’ve just been waiting for another Resident Evil 4. </p>",

    "title": "PS5 Pro likely to support 8K and ray tracing and share launch window with Nintendo Switch 2",
    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> Rumors of a PS5 Pro persist, and while the powered-up version of the current&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/ps5\">PS5</a>&nbsp;console has not been officially confirmed by Sony, one reliable insider has claimed it's&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/news/ps5-pro-reportedly-100-in-development-and-dev-kits-could-ship-this-year\">“100% in development”</a>&nbsp;and the online whispers refuse to quieten down.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> A PS5 Pro would make even more sense as a form of stop-gap between the PS5 and what we'll dub the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/features/upgrades-we-want-ps6\">PS6</a>. That's because, in legal documents pertaining to the battle between Microsoft and the FTC over the former's acquisition of Activision Blizzard,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-expects-the-next-generation-of-consoles-to-come-out-in-2028\" target=\"_blank\">IGN</a>&nbsp;found that Microsoft doesn't expect a next-generation PlayStation or Xbox until 2028. So a mid-generation refresh would seem logical given the potential length of this current generation of games consoles.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> We expect the PS5 Pro will follow the lead of its precursor, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/ps4-pro,review-4036.html\">PS4 Pro</a>. Essentially, this was a more powerful version of the base&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/sony-ps4-review,review-1939.html\">PS4</a>&nbsp;console. It packed the same DualShock 4 controller and library of games but was capable of increased performance and targeted 4K resolution on select titles.

This would line up with the three-year gap we saw between the PS4 (November 2013) and the PS4 Pro (November 2016), but more recent rumors have poured cold water on the idea that we’re mere months away from the rumored console launching.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_tom_henderson_?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Henderson</a>&nbsp;of Insider Gaming has repeatedly suggested that the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/news/ps5-pro-tipped-for-2024-launch-but-do-we-even-need-it\">PS5 Pro will launch in 2024</a>&nbsp;as part of Sony’s ambitious upcoming hardware lineup that will also include a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/news/new-ps5-model-tipped-to-launch-in-2023-heres-whats-new\">revised standard PS5 model</a>&nbsp;(with a detachable disc drive) and a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/news/new-playstation-handheld-may-have-leaked-and-it-sounds-promising-but-pointless\">new handheld device</a>&nbsp;centered around the console’s Remote Play feature.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Henderson’s assertion that we’ll have to wait until next year for the PS5 Pro has been backed by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/news/ps5-pro-could-launch-in-2024-and-offer-twice-the-performance\">additional sources suggesting a 2024 release date</a>&nbsp;is most likely. Plus, another leaker has claimed the PS5 Pro and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/news/nintendo-switch-2-rumors-are-heating-up-again-heres-why\">Nintendo Switch 2</a>&nbsp;will&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/news/ps5-pro-and-new-nintendo-switch-tipped-to-share-launch-window\">share a launch window</a>. And as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/news/nintendo-confirms-no-switch-2-this-year-despite-hardware-sales-slowdown\">Nintendo has effectively ruled out</a>&nbsp;any new hardware in 2023, that would place the PS5 Pro launch outside of the next seven or so months.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> In May of this year, Sony held its latest PlayStation Showcase event, and there was no sign of the PS5 Pro at all. This would definitely suggest that official news on the rumored console is not imminent. But at least&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/opinion/ignore-the-social-media-complainers-the-playstation-showcase-2023-was-fantastic\">the showcase was an excellent presentation</a>&nbsp;of some brilliant-looking PS5 games!&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> When it comes to price, there is precious little out there to even give us an indication of how much we need to save up ahead of time. At release in 2016, the PS4 Pro cost $399, this was the same price the base PS4 had launched for three years earlier. Of course, three years into the PS4’s lifecycle the console had already received a price cut, which hasn’t happened for the PS5.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> If the PS5 Pro was to follow the trend of the last generation, it would launch for $499. However, don’t be surprised if the PS5 Pro is pitched at an even higher cost, maybe even $599. Sony proved with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/news/psvr-2-release-date-price-new-controllers-leaks-and-latest-news\">PSVR 2</a>&nbsp;($549 launch price), it’s not afraid to charge a premium price for new hardware, so you might want to start saving those pennies as soon as possible because the PS5 Pro could be one expensive console. &nbsp;&nbsp; </p><h2>PS5 Pro potential specs&nbsp;</h2><figure class=\"fig-img\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img   \" src=\"https://chronopin.blob.core.windows.net/thumb/9a3f2beb-489a-48ba-9214-ec400b679d9b-chrono-lg.webp\" alt=\"Image credit: AMD\" height=\"563\" width=\"1000\"><figcaption class=\"fig-cap\">Image credit: AMD</figcaption></figure><p class=\"paragraph\"> When it comes to the PS5 Pro specs there are two words that keep cropping up: 8K and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/features/ps5-and-xbox-series-x-ray-tracing-heres-why-its-a-big-deal\">ray tracing</a>. We would expect these to be the two areas that Sony attempts to target with any form of revised PS5 hardware.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> YouTuber&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlqq7JrJujI&amp;t=858s\" target=\"_blank\">Moore’s Law is Dead</a>, has predicted that the PS5 Pro will be positioned as an 8K console to go hand-in-hand with Sony’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-8k-tvs\">8K TVs</a>. While the current PS5 does claim to have 8K capacities, we’ve seen very few games run at that resolution on the hardware, and none of them are the most graphically demanding titles on the console.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> By the end of this year or early next year, there should be new AMD chips available for Sony to make use of in its next hardware. The base PS5 currently uses an AMD Zen 2-based processor and RDNA 2 graphics on a custom chipset, but the PS5 Pro may instead sport a refreshed Ryzen APU, as suggested by Paul Eccleston of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKv5etX567U\" target=\"_blank\">RedGamingTech</a>.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> According to Paul’s source, a revised PS5 console would also aim to offer significantly stronger ray-tracing performance. Ray tracing has become a bit of a marketing buzzword in recent months, but it’s essentially a rendering technique that produces more realistic lighting effects.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-pro-in-development/\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Henderson also suggests</a>&nbsp;that the PS5 Pro will have a strong focus on ray tracing and that legendary PlayStation console architect Mark Cerny is involved in the creation of the hardware.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> We’d speculate the PS5 Pro could be very much like the PS4 Pro in that it could use up-mixing and checkerboard rendering to produce an 8K image out of one that’s rendered at a lower resolution. We’ve seen Nvidia have a lot of success with its deep-learning super sampling (DLSS) tech on the likes of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/news/where-to-buy-the-nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080\">GeForce RTX 3080</a>. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> There’s been a big push for player choice so far this console generation with many PS5 and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/xbox-series-x\">Xbox Series X</a>&nbsp;games offering either a “Performance” or “Quality” mode. The former typically targets a higher framerate, the latter a better resolution. It seems likely that the PS5 Pro would build upon this. We don’t expect a console that would be capable of running the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/the-best-ps5-games\">best PS5 games</a>&nbsp;in 8K at 120 fps with full ray tracing enabled. But instead, players may be able to further choose which elements are most important to them.&nbsp; </p><h2>PS5 Pro possible features&nbsp;</h2><figure class=\"fig-img\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img   \" src=\"https://chronopin.blob.core.windows.net/thumb/1cccca05-be1d-4c1e-839c-dc9b50d39336-chrono-lg.webp\" alt=\"Image credit: Art Station/Mark Illing\" height=\"563\" width=\"1000\"><figcaption class=\"fig-cap\">Image credit: Art Station/Mark Illing</figcaption></figure><p class=\"paragraph\"> We think it’s highly unlikely that the PS5 Pro will offer any exclusive features per sey. As discussed above, it will likely boast more powerful internal components, but we don’t expect its upgrades will extend further into exclusive features or games.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The PS5 Pro is pretty much guaranteed to play all the same games as the PS5, and the current&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/opinion/horizon-forbidden-west-has-me-loving-the-ps5-dualsense-again\">DualSense</a>&nbsp;controller will almost certainly be the primary way you interact with the console. There is perhaps a possibility that the PS5 Pro will come packing the high-end&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/sony-dualsense-edge\">DualSense Edge</a>&nbsp;controller. But we wouldn’t bet on it as Sony likely wants to sell that premium $199 accessory separately to the most passionate PlayStation players. &nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> It’s also been theorized that the PS5 Pro will work in harmony with the recently released&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/psvr2-review\">PSVR 2</a>&nbsp;headset. This would make sense as virtual reality is clearly an area of great interest for Sony, and we expect its latest VR device will be supported for many years to come. There is a reasonable chance that PSVR 2 will also be able to take advantage of the increased power of the PS5 Pro for improved performance levels or sharper visuals. &nbsp;&nbsp; </p><h2>PS5 Pro early outlook&nbsp;</h2><figure class=\"fig-img\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img   \" src=\"https://chronopin.blob.core.windows.net/thumb/905b23d0-ed6a-4647-97a4-e74f6fc4e286-chrono-lg.webp\" alt=\"Image credit: Future\" height=\"563\" width=\"1000\"><figcaption class=\"fig-cap\">Image credit: Future</figcaption></figure><p class=\"paragraph\"> Even though the PS5 will celebrate its third birthday this November, in many ways, it still feels like this console generation has barely begun. Publishers have opted to release their biggest games on both PS5 and PS4 over the past two years, and this includes heavy-hitting PlayStation exclusives like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/horizon-forbidden-west\">Horizon: Forbidden West</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/god-of-war-ragnarok\">God of War Ragnarök</a>. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> It looks like 2023 will be the year that the PS4 is finally left behind, but it still feels like we’re at least a couple of years away from the base PS5 console really hitting its stride. If a PS5 Pro was to release in 2024, it would arguably come too early, launching just as the potential of its predecessor is being fully unlocked.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> However, some recent high-profile games have been released in a less-than-impressive technical state (<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review\">Star Wars Jedi Survivor</a>&nbsp;is a prime example). So there are definitely reasons to believe that developers could do with a little bit more power to play with, and the PS5 Pro could give them just that.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Sony would also pitch the PS5 Pro as a product designed specifically for the most enthusiastic gamers. It would not be intended as a replacement for the regular PS5, which would likely continue to be Sony's main console.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> And the PS5 could have a bit of a captive audience, as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/opinion/xbox-series-x-isnt-getting-an-upgrade-anytime-soon-but-it-doesnt-need-one\">Xbox boss Phil Spencer has said that we can't expect an upgraded Xbox Series X anytime soon</a>. That could mean the PS5 Pro stands alone in a mid-generation refresh, especially if it arrives this year.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The PS5 Pro is highly likely to be marketed towards players who want the highest possible resolution, with the most stable framerates, and wouldn’t be designed to replace the standard PS5 hardware. The two could co-exist, as the PS4 and PS4 Pro did for several years. And as lovers of cutting-edge gaming ourselves, the various PS5 Pro floating around the internet have definitely got our attention.&nbsp; </p>",

Even though Aqua is putting on a act for the show, Kana feels jealous at how he is interacting with his female co-stars. Meanwhile, Miyako gets to work starting up Strawberry Productions' new idol unit. She decides to have Ruby and Kana make their debut online, and enlists the help of one of their veteran internet personalities, Pieyon, a masked physical training YouTuber. Pieyon determines that the quickest way for the girls to gain a following is to collaborate with his established channel. They perform a rigorous workout dance routine for an hour straight, with Ruby earning Kana's respect after seeing her last the entire hour. Pieyon then asks them what their group name will be, and Ruby decides to revive the name of B Komachi. </p>",

Photo: AFP</figcaption></figure><p class=\"paragraph\"> “With the worst yet to come for many developed economies, we think exports will decline further before bottoming out later this year,” economists at Capital Economics said. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> China’s weak exports confirmed the need to rely on domestic demand, said Zhang Zhiwei, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, as the global economy slows. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> “There is more pressure for the government to boost domestic consumption in the rest of the year, as global demand will likely weaken further in the second half,” he said. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Beijing has pledged to shore up trade to support the overall economic recovery, but China’s exports have struggled due to weak global demand. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The year-on-year fall in China’s shipments to the United States accelerated to 18.24 per cent in May, compared to 6.5 per cent in April, marking the 10th straight month of decline. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Meanwhile, exports to the European Union returned to negative growth by falling 7.03 per cent compared to the same time last year, after two months of brief uptick. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Shipments to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which were the major driver of China’s robust headline exports in March and April, fell by 15.92 per cent in May. The 10-nation bloc is China’s largest trade partner. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Trade with Russia, however, remained strong last month, with Chinese exports increasing by 114.32 per cent year on year, although the trading volume between the two countries is much smaller. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> In May, the export orders subindex of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/economy/economic-indicators/article/3222374/chinas-economic-recovery-continues-stutter-manufacturing-activity-contracts-further-may?module=inline&amp;pgtype=article&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=article&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=article\">China’s official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index</a>&nbsp;fell further into contraction, dropping to 47.2 from 47.6 in April, after showing an expansion in February and March. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Imports, meanwhile, declined by 4.5 per cent in May from a year earlier to US$217.7 billion, narrowing from a fall of 7.9 per cent April. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The decline was largely due to falling commodity import bills, as global energy prices were down 33.9 per cent year on year in May, while global food prices fell 16.3 per cent, according to Lloyd Chan, senior economist at Oxford Economics. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The disappointing economic activity data in April, which included retail sales, industrial production and fixed-asset investment, suggested China’s domestic demand recovery had lost steam following the reopening-induced bounce in the first quarter, he added. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> “This will continue to constrain Chinese goods import growth. Plus, slowing global demand will weigh on capital goods imports,” said Chan. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> “We anticipate the [People’s Bank of China] will cut the reserve requirement ratio in the coming months to further spur the domestic recovery.” </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> China last cut the reserve requirement ratio, the amount that banks must set aside for deposits,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3213918/china-releases-us726-billion-liquidity-cut-banks-reserve-requirement-ratio?module=inline&amp;pgtype=article\">by 25 basis points in March.</a> </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Wednesday’s data also confirmed China’s trade surplus fell to US$65.8 billion in May, narrowing from US$90.2 billion in April and US$78.4 billion a year ago. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> “Still, the cumulative trade surplus from January-May was US$360 billion, much larger than the same period a year ago (US$281 billion). This should help provide a measure of support for the Chinese yuan,” Chan added. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The yuan’s exchange rate against the US dollar has continued to weaken recently, after falling below a key psychological threshold of 7 per US dollar in May. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Wang Tao, head of Asia economics and chief China economist at UBS Investment Bank, said if China’s growth momentum continues to weaken with disappointing exports, consumption and property activities, Beijing would roll out more positive policies such as boosting infrastructure investment, rolling out targeted consumption support and further easing property policies. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> “The upcoming July Politburo meeting is the key time window to watch for policy tone change, while regular State Council meetings in the next two-three months may deliver some details,” Wang said. </p>",

    "title": "LGBTQ people flock to Florida for Disney's Gay Days celebration at the start of Pride Month",
    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\">   LGBTQ people are flocking to Florida this weekend to take part in Gay Days, Disney's Pride celebration.   </p><p class=\"paragraph\">   It’s not lost on the organizers that the highlight of the weekend will be a Saturday meetup of LGBTQ visitors at the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World, where the first Gay Days started as a single-day celebration in 1991. Traditionally, participants wear red shirts to identify themselves, and they meet for the afternoon parade in front of Cinderella’s Castle.   </p><p class=\"paragraph\">   Currently, Disney is embroiled in a legal fight with DeSantis over the governor and Republican lawmakers’ takeover of Disney World’s governing district — after Disney officials publicly opposed legislation that critics have dubbed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/desantis-florida-dont-say-gay-ban-684ed25a303f83208a89c556543183cb\">“Don’t Say Gay.”</a>   </p><p class=\"paragraph\">   In response, some Florida cities, including St. Cloud near Orlando, have canceled Pride events altogether.   </p><p class=\"paragraph\">   “These laws have created a climate of fear and hostility for LGBTQIA+ people in Florida,” organizers for St. Cloud’s Pride events&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/258518346566430/?active_tab=discussion\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a>&nbsp;to announce the cancellation. “We believe that holding an LGBTQIA+ event in this environment would put our community at risk.”   </p><p class=\"paragraph\">  Even though Gov. Ron DeSantis and Florida lawmakers have championed a slew of anti-LGBTQ laws — spurring the most prominent gay rights group in the U.S. and other civil rights organizations to issue&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.eqfl.org/florida-travel-advisory\" target=\"_blank\">warnings</a>&nbsp;the Sunshine State may no longer be safe — Gay Days organizers are still encouraging visitors from around the world to come to one of Florida’s largest gay and lesbian celebrations.  </p><p class=\"paragraph\">  They say a large turnout will send a message that LGBTQ people are not going away in Florida, which is continually one of the most popular states for tourists to visit. If the hoped-for 150,000 or more visitors come to the half-week of pool parties, drag bingo and thrill rides at Orlando’s theme parks and hotels, then “that’s the point,” said Joseph Clark, CEO of Gay Days Inc.  </p><p class=\"paragraph\">  “Right now is not the time to run. It’s not the time to go away,” Clark said. “It’s time to show we are here, we are queer and we aren’t going anywhere.”  </p>",

    "title": "What to Expect From WWDC 2023: AR/VR Headset, 15-Inch MacBook Air, Mac Studio, iOS 17, xrOS, macOS 14 and More",
    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\">   Apple is expected to introduce its first new wearable since the launch of the Apple Watch, plus there are new Macs coming and notable features for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/\">watchOS 10</a>. This guide highlights everything rumored to be coming at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/\">WWDC 2023</a>.   </p><h2>Hardware</h2><p class=\"paragraph\">   We don't always get hardware at WWDC, and in fact, the event usually focuses on software. Every once in awhile, though, Apple has a new product to show off that's timed well for a June launch, and that's the case this year.   </p><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ar-vr/\">AR/VR Headset</a></h3><p class=\"paragraph\">   Apple's AR/VR headset has been in active development for years now, and Apple has pushed it back several times to work out ongoing issues. We're expecting to get our first glimpse at the headset at WWDC, though it is not expected to officially launch until later in the year.   </p><p class=\"paragraph\">   The headset is expected to have a thin and light design that will make it more comfortable to wear than competing products, and the lighter weight will be primarily facilitated by an external battery pack that's worn at the hip and connected to the headset through a USB-C cable. Apple wants the headset to weigh around 200 grams, which would be notably lighter than other options.  </p><p class=\"paragraph\">   Battery life will come in at around two hours, but because it's using an external battery pack, batteries will be swappable for longer wear. The headset will support both virtual reality and augmented reality, with a physical Digital Crown-like button to switch between modes.   </p><p class=\"paragraph\">   Leaked design information suggests the headset will be made from aluminum, glass, and carbon fiber, with a look that's not too far off from other VR headsets like the PlayStation VR 2 or the Oculus Quest 2. It will have a sleek front visor that's held on with an Apple Watch-like band, with a mesh that sits against the face.   </p><p class=\"paragraph\">   Two 4K microOLED displays from Sony will offer high-resolution content in a 120-degree field of view, with Apple aiming for 5,000 nits brightness for HDR and 4,000 pixels per inch. HDR is not a typical feature for VR headsets, and that pixel density will outshine all competing headsets. Prescription lenses will be accommodated, and the internal lenses will be able to be adjusted to match the wearer's interpupillary distance.   </p><p class=\"paragraph\">   More than a dozen cameras will track hand movements, leg movements, and facial gestures, plus iris scanning will be available for authentication. Capturing lower body movement is not something most headsets do, and Apple plans to use the cameras to track hand and eye gestures for control purposes. Users will, for example, be able to look at an on-screen item to select it, using hand gestures to interact with it. An \"air-typing\" feature will be available for text input, though Apple also plans to allow users to enter text with an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, similar to how the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>&nbsp;works. The cameras will also map the surrounding environment for augmented reality applications, with LiDAR scanners also included.   </p><p class=\"paragraph\">   While the headset can connect to a Mac to display what's on the Mac's screen, it is designed to operate independently. There are two Mac-level&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a>&nbsp;processors inside, one that's a higher-end chip and one that's a lower-end chip for powering sensors.   </p><p class=\"paragraph\">   The AR/VR headset will run a new operating system that's likely to be called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/xros/\">xrOS</a>, with the xr standing for \"extended reality.\" ‌xrOS‌ will be immediately familiar to iOS users, and Apple is developing dedicated apps for the device.

There will be a media focus with Apple planning to provide a dedicated TV app, and Apple is teaming up with companies like Disney and Dolby for content.   </p><p class=\"paragraph\">   Apple is already working with gaming developers to help them update their existing content for mixed reality, and ‌FaceTime‌ will also be a focus. ‌FaceTime‌ will support one-on-one chats with realistic avatars featuring a user's actual face and body, while multi-person chats will use Memojis.   </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> <chronodollar class=\"chrono-dollar-highlight\">$AAPL</chronodollar>&nbsp; </p>",

Without mentioning names, Cisco also shared that the chips from its SiliconOne series are currently being tested by five of the six major cloud providers. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> According to data collected by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/chart/18819/worldwide-market-share-of-leading-cloud-infrastructure-service-providers/\">Synergy Research Group</a>, the four biggest cloud providers in the world include Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Alibaba Cloud. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Just like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://techhq.com/2023/01/apple-to-ditch-broadcom-qualcomm-for-its-in-house-chips-by-2025/\">Broadcom</a>, Cisco is a major supplier of networking equipment, too, including ethernet switches, which connect devices such as computers, laptops, routers, servers, and printers to a local area network. </p><figure class=\"fig-img\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img   \" src=\"https://chronopin.blob.core.windows.net/thumb/48b2faa4-76e8-4531-acf6-4efeabc2b148-chrono-lg.webp\" alt=\"Benefits of large radix 51.2 Tbps switches\" height=\"555\" width=\"1000\"><figcaption class=\"fig-cap\">Benefits of large radix 51.2 Tbps switches</figcaption></figure><p class=\"paragraph\"> The Cisco Silicon One G200 and G202 are uniquely positioned in the industry with advanced features to optimize real-world performance of AI/ML workloads—while simultaneously driving down the cost, power, and latency of the network with significant innovations. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The Cisco Silicon One G200 is the ideal solution for Ethernet-based AI/ML networks for several reasons: </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> ~ With the industry’s highest radix switch, with 512 x 100GE Ethernet ports on one device, customers can build a 32K 400G GPUs AI/ML cluster with a 2-layer network requiring 50% less optics, 40% fewer switches, and 33% fewer networking layers—drastically reducing the environmental footprint of the AI/ML cluster. This saves up to 9 million kWh per year, which according to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator#results\">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>&nbsp;is equivalent to more than 6,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2e) or burning 7.3 million pounds of coal per year. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> ~ Advanced congestion-aware load balancing techniques enable networks to avoid traditional congestion events. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> ~ Advanced packet-spraying techniques minimize creation of congestion hot spots in the network. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> ~ Advanced hardware-based link-failure recovery delivers optimal performance across massive web-scale networks, even in the presence of faults. </p><h2>Here’s a closer look at some of our many Cisco Silicon One–related innovations:</h2><h3>Converged architecture</h3><p class=\"paragraph\"> ~ Cisco Silicon One provides one architecture that can be deployed across customer networks, from routing roles to web-scale front-end networks to web-scale back-end networks, dramatically reducing deployment timelines, while simultaneously minimizing ongoing operations costs by enabling a converged infrastructure. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> ~ Using a common software development kit (SDK) and standard Switch Abstraction Interface (SAI) layers, customers need only port the Cisco Silicon One environment to their network operating system (NOS) once and make use of that investment across diverse network roles. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> ~ Like all our devices, the Cisco Silicon One G200 has a large and fully unified packet-buffer optimizing burst-absorption and throughput in large web-scale networks. This minimizes head-of-line blocking by absorbing bursts instead of the generation of priority flow control. </p><h3>Optimization across the entire value chain</h3><p class=\"paragraph\"> ~ The Cisco Silicon One G200 has up to two times higher radix than other solutions with 512 Ethernet MACs, enabling customers to significantly reduce the cost, power, and latency of network deployments by removing layers of their network. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> ~ With our own internally developed, next-generation, SerDes technology, the Cisco Silicon One G200 device is capable of driving 43 dB bump-to-bump channels that enable co-packaged optics (CPO), linear pluggable objects (LPO), and the use of 4-meter 26 AWG copper cables, which is well beyond IEEE standards for optimal in-rack connectivity. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> ~ The Silicon One G200 is over two times more power efficient with two times lower latency compared to our already optimized Cisco Silicon One G100 device. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> ~ The physical design and layout of the device is built with a system-first approach, allowing customers to run system fans slower, dramatically decreasing system power draw. </p><h3>Innovative load balancing and fault detection</h3><p class=\"paragraph\"> ~ Support for non-correlated, weighted equal-cost multipath (WECMP) and equal-cost multipath (ECMP) load balancing capabilities with near-ideal characteristics help to avoid hash polarization, even across massive networks. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> ~ Congestion-aware load balancing for stateful ECMP, flow, and flowlet enables optimal network throughput with optimal flow-completion time and job-completion time (JCT). </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> ~ Congestion-aware stateless packet spraying enables near ideal JCT by using all available network bandwidth, regardless of flow characteristics. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> ~ Support for hardware-based redistribution of packets based on link failures enables Cisco Silicon One G200 to optimize real-world throughput of massive scale networks. </p><h3>Advanced packet processor</h3><p class=\"paragraph\"> ~ The Cisco Silicon One G200 uses the industry’s first fully custom, P4 programmable parallel packet processor capable of launching more than 435 billion lookups per second. It supports advanced features like SRv6 Micro-SID (uSID) at full rate and is extendable with full run-to-completion processing for even more complex flows. This unique packet processing architecture enables flexibility with deterministic low latency and power. </p><h3>Deep visibility and analytics</h3><p class=\"paragraph\"> ~ Programmable processors enable support for standard and emerging web-scale in-band telemetry standards providing industry-leading network visibility. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> ~ Embedded hardware analyzers detect microbursts with pre- and post-event logging of temporal flow information, giving network operators the ability to analyze network events after the fact with hardware time visibility. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> <chronodollar class=\"chrono-dollar-highlight\">$CSCO</chronodollar> </p>",

    "title": "Final Fantasy 16: Release Date, Story, And Everything We Know",
    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\">   Six years have passed since the last mainline installment in the decidedly not-so-final Final Fantasy series, making this one of the largest gaps between games in the series' 35 years of history. However, all that waiting seems to be for good reason. What we've seen from Final Fantasy XVI makes the game look like a high-fantasy epic combining the grandeur of older titles with the cutting-edge technology of newer games, making us hopeful that this next entry will be well worth the wait.   </p><p class=\"paragraph\">  It's worth noting, however, that the game will not be cross-generation, meaning PS4 owners will have to make the move to PS5 in order to play it. Square Enix shared this news during the game's reveal trailer, noting, \"The following content is captured on PC emulating the PS5 experience,\" before adding the latest entry in the Final Fantasy saga will, \"not [be] available on other platforms for a limited time after release on PS5.\" </p><div class=\"embed\"><iframe class=\"embed-youtube\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aPT26Dd3OzE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen ></iframe></div><h2>Gameplay</h2><p class=\"paragraph\">  FFXVI takes on an action-RPG style of combat and looks like it shares similarities to FFXV and FF7 Remake. This is not all that surprising, given&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-dumped-traditional-turn-based-combat-so-that-it-could-appeal-to-younger-gamers/1100-6505477/\">producer Naoki Yoshida's sentiments regarding turn-based systems and their lack of allure to younger gamers</a>. In battle, protagonist Clive can cast fireballs, engage at melee range with his sword and warp-like abilities, and use a few powers that look like they're tied to Eikons (indicated by the stone fist summoned in the fight against a Dragoon).  </p><p class=\"paragraph\">  While Clive is the central character and the player protagonist, he won't be the only adventurer on a quest. Clive will be accompanied by AI-controlled party members who will banter and connect throughout the game, as well as a \"faithful buddy\" character to whom you can give direct commands to. Clive, though, will remain the central character, and the game will follow him through three periods in his life: his teens, 20s, and 30s.  </p><p class=\"paragraph\">  Ryota Suzuki, who was a combat designer for Devil May Cry 5 and Dragon's Dogma, is the battle director for FFXVI, which could result in something quite exciting. And despite this renewed focus on action, producer Naoki Yoshida noted that this new approach will<a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-will-be-more-action-oriented-but-not-at-the-expense-of-its-story/1100-6487880/\">&nbsp;not come at the expense of the game's story</a>.  </p><p class=\"paragraph\">  During April's State of Play, PlayStation and Square Enix<a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-xvi-state-of-play-showcases-real-time-combat-and-world-exploration/1100-6513260/\">&nbsp;showed off 20 minutes of gameplay</a>&nbsp;that revealed more about combat, world exploration, story, and side content. Real-time action combat, which is relatively new for the franchise, will see Clive fighting enemies using his powerful abilities and with Eikons that he can control.

New claims fell in most other states. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Unemployment claims typically rise when the economy weakens and a recession approaches. They’ve increased since the beginning of the year but are still quite low. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Key details:&nbsp;A sharp increase in jobless claims in the past month has fueled talk that the labor market is finally feeling the effects of the rising interest rates orchestrated by the Federal Reserve to quench high inflation. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> New filings have risen above 260,000, from around 230,000 in early May. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The unadjusted figures tell a similar story. Actual jobless claims totaled 250,000 in the latest week, up from around 200,000 as recently as the beginning of May. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Still, not every state is showing a steady increase. Most of the rise in new claims last week was concentrated in California, with Connecticut and New Jersey also reporting sizable gains. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Yet new jobless claims also fell in 36 of the 53 states and territories that report these figures to the federal government. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The number of people collecting unemployment benefits in the U.S., meanwhile, is telling a somewhat different story. That number dipped by 13,000 to 1.78 million. It has now fallen in four of the past six weeks, after hitting a one-and-a-half-year high of 1.83 million in April. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> “The diverging momentum in initial claims and continuing claims raises the obvious question about which data is telling the right story, and how long can this condition persist,” said Thomas Simons, U.S. economist at Jefferies. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Further complicating the picture has been another surge in fraudulent filings this year. That could help explain the divergence between the recent rise in new applications for benefits but not in ongoing claims. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Big picture:&nbsp;Job openings and hiring have slowed since last year and layoffs have risen — a sign to some economists of an impending recession. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Yet by virtually any measure, the labor market is still robust. The U.S. is adding more than 200,000 jobs a month, unemployment is extremely low at 3.7% and wages are rising rapidly. The rise in claims stands in stark contrast. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The Fed is worried that a tight labor market will make it harder to get inflation fully under control. After a “pause” in June, the central bank is primed to raise interest rates again to slow the economy even further to ease price pressures. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Looking ahead:&nbsp;“Our view remains that layoffs will rise less dramatically than normally might occur [in a slowing economy], as companies do all they can to avoid shedding workers who have been incredibly difficult to recruit and retain,” said chief economist Joshua Shapiro of MFR Inc. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> <chronohash class=\"chrono-hash-highlight\">#InitialJoblessClaims</chronohash> </p>",

    "description": "<div class=\"embed\"><iframe class=\"embed-youtube\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WcNV39BHtq0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen ></iframe></div><p class=\"paragraph\"> The Supreme Court&nbsp;<a href=\"https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/SCOTUS-biden-nebraska-opinion.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">threw out the Biden administration</a>’s plan to forgive student loans held by 40 million Americans, ending a $430 billion program the White House considers a crucial way to cement the president’s support among younger Americans. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> <a href=\"https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/SCOTUS-biden-nebraska-opinion.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">The 6-3 decision</a>&nbsp;by Chief Justice&nbsp;John Roberts&nbsp;said that while Education Secretary&nbsp;Miguel Cardona&nbsp;holds some power under federal law to alter the terms of student aid programs, the massive plan he approved last year vastly exceeded the authority Congress delegated to the executive branch. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The Heroes Act, which permits the secretary to modify the programs to respond to emergencies, doesn’t permit him “to rewrite that statute from the ground up,” Roberts wrote, joined by Justices&nbsp;Clarence Thomas,&nbsp;Samuel Alito,&nbsp;Neil Gorsuch,&nbsp;Brett Kavanaugh&nbsp;and&nbsp;Amy Coney Barrett. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Writing in dissent for the court’s three liberals, Justice&nbsp;Elena Kagan&nbsp;said the majority had read into the law a restriction that wasn’t there. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The law’s text doesn’t expressly limit the secretary’s judgment about the waivers or modifications needed to deal with an emergency, she wrote. “That may have been a good idea, or it may have been a bad idea. Either way, it was what Congress said,” she wrote, joined by Justices&nbsp;Sonia Sotomayor&nbsp;and&nbsp;Ketanji Brown Jackson. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Beyond its financial implications,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-student-loan-case-test-limits-of-presidential-power-4402d2ae?mod=article_inline\">the case&nbsp;</a>brought to the fore vastly different views of executive power espoused by the White House and the Supreme Court. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> President Biden has at times sought to take aggressive actions in response to economic, immigration and other crises as partisan divisions hobble Congress. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The court, with a conservative majority skeptical of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-limits-environmental-protection-agencys-authority-11656598034?mod=article_inline\">federal regulatory power</a>, has blocked several administration initiatives and limited agency authority to act on new situations that existing legislation might not have anticipated. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> “I believe that the Court’s decision to strike down our student debt relief plan is wrong,” the president said. “But I will stop at nothing to find other ways to deliver relief to hard-working middle-class families.” </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, who was a party to the case Biden v. Nebraska, hailed the justices’ decision. “This means that the state coffers will not suffer a $44 million hit,” he said, adding: “This one was personal. I paid for my college with blood, sweat and tears in service to my country and it’s only fair that working families not be stuck with other people’s debt.” </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Progressive lawmakers, meanwhile, called on Biden to take another crack at wide-ranging loan forgiveness using different legal authority. “This fight is not over. The president has more tools to cancel student debt—and he must use them,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) one of Congress’ leading advocates for debt cancellation. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> As a presidential candidate in 2020, Biden said he would pursue legislation to erase $10,000 in student debt per borrower. Once in office, however, he confronted a gridlocked Congress where neither Democratic efforts to cancel student debt nor Republican bills to prohibit loan forgiveness survived. Under pressure from progressives to make good on the promise, Biden chose to make permanent the decision to forgive certain borrowers’ student debt during the Covid-19 emergency. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Biden initially doubted the administration’s ability to take such a step. “I don’t think I have the authority to do it by signing with a pen,” he said during a CNN town hall in 2021. But after months of internal debate and additional legal research by administration officials, the president concluded that emergency powers Congress had granted the education secretary included the discretion to permanently forgive student-loan debt. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The key language was contained in the Heroes Act, a federal law adopted after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. It was expanded during the wars that followed to ensure that those involved in a military operation or national emergency “are not placed in a worse position financially” because of those events. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> During the Covid-19 pandemic, officials of both the Trump and Biden administrations paused student-loan repayments. But the Heroes Act language didn’t specify relief must be temporary or that the government must be made whole. </p><figure class=\"fig-img\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img   \" src=\"https://chronopin.blob.core.windows.net/thumb/409563ef-8f6c-49f8-a7ff-328cd50f621c-chrono-lg.webp\" alt=\"Supreme Court Strikes Down Biden’s Student-Loan Forgiveness Plan\" height=\"666\" width=\"1000\"><figcaption class=\"fig-cap\">Supreme Court Strikes Down Biden’s Student-Loan Forgiveness Plan</figcaption></figure><p class=\"paragraph\"> Days before leaving office in January 2021, the Trump Education Department’s top lawyer signed an eight-page memo concluding that while the statute didn’t explicitly bar blanket loan forgiveness, such a prohibition could be inferred from its structure. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Cardona, Biden’s education secretary, didn’t see it that way. In August 2022, he authorized permanent forgiveness of up to $10,000 for borrowers who earn less than $125,000 a year, with an additional $10,000 of relief for those who held Pell Grants, which typically are awarded to the neediest students. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The directive cited the department’s experience when it paused loan repayments for borrowers affected by natural disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires. The default rate was 0.3% in the calendar year before the disaster, but rose to 6.5% when repayment obligations resumed for borrowers whose bills had been paused. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Along with Cardona’s directive came a supporting legal opinion from Assistant Attorney General Christopher Schroeder, head of the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel. Schroeder’s memo argued that the Heroes Act gave the education secretary broad discretion to waive or modify student-aid programs because of the emergency. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Unpersuaded Republican officials in six states sued to block the plan, contending among other things that it would harm state finances because the discharged debt wouldn’t be classified as taxable income. They argued that the education secretary lacked authority to erase billions of dollars of debt from the Treasury’s books. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> A federal appeals court in St. Louis sided with the Republican states, issuing orders to block the plan while litigation proceeded. A federal judge in Fort Worth, Texas, hearing a suit from borrowers who complained they weren’t eligible for the maximum relief provided to others with student loans, issued a similar order. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The administration appealed to the Supreme Court, which heard the argument in February. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Sotomayor said millions of students would benefit from the program, adding, “Many of them don’t have assets sufficient to bail them out after the pandemic.” </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Roberts highlighted the hardship that fell on those who hadn’t taken on student debt. Imagine, he said, a high-school graduate who borrowed money to set up a lawn-care business, while a classmate instead went to college on a student loan. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> “Nobody is telling the person who is trying to set up the lawn-service business that he does not have to pay his loan,” Roberts said, “even though his tax dollars are” subsidizing his classmate. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The White House has been preparing for the court to overturn the program for weeks, people familiar with the matter said. The Education Department is expected to soon complete a proposal to offer borrowers new options for income-based repayment of their loans. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The administration hopes that low-income borrowers will enroll in the income-based repayment program, which would allow them to pay a set percentage of their discretionary incomes each month.

Businesses are pledging to shutter their doors for the day to protest Gov. Ron DeSantis' sweeping new immigration law. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> For years,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/05/24/1166796229/ron-densantis-president-election-2024\">the Republican presidential hopeful</a>&nbsp;has railed relentlessly against U.S. immigration policies and newly arrived asylum-seekers. Senate Bill 1718, which takes effect on July 1, will offer a preview of the controversial changes DeSantis has said he'd like to see Congress implement. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Among its provisions, the strict&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2023/1718\">new state legislation</a>&nbsp;limits social services for undocumented immigrants, allocates millions more tax dollars to expand DeSantis'&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/02/10/1155806778/desantis-florida-republicans-migrant-transport-millions\">migrant relocation program</a>, invalidates driver's licenses issued to undocumented people by other states, and requires hospitals that get Medicaid dollars to ask for a patient's immigration status. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> But the most worrisome measures — for businesses and undocumented immigrants alike — are the host of penalties for those who violate new employment mandates. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Supporters say it will help expel the recent influx of immigrants, stave off future arrivals, and provide more job opportunities to&nbsp;citizens and others in the country lawfully. Critics say it will cost the state billions in lost revenue, while many of the harshest penalties are unlikely to be enforced. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Here's a look at key provisions of the law and how they may impact the state's economy. </p><h3>E-Verify requirements</h3><p class=\"paragraph\"> What the law says: </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> To crack down on businesses hiring undocumented workers, SB 1718 will require private employers with 25 or more employees that are making new hires&nbsp;to use E-Verify, the federal online database that employers use to confirm whether someone is eligible to work in the U.S. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> What the potential impacts are: </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Business advocates across the state are concerned. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Samuel Vilchez Santiago, Florida director of the American Business Immigration Coalition, an advocacy group for immigration reform that benefits businesses,<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/05/14/1176062248/florida-businesses-could-be-required-to-verify-employees-have-legal-work-permits\">&nbsp;told</a>&nbsp;NPR's&nbsp;Weekend Edition Sunday&nbsp;that the change will likely have a significant impact on Florida's agriculture, construction and hospitality sectors. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> \"These are industries where immigrants make up the vast majority of workers, and not allowing businesses to be able to utilize these workers will have a really big impact on our economy and their ability to create jobs,\" Vilchez said. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> That's a big problem for Florida, where there's already a widespread labor shortage and the unemployment rate is low — just<a href=\"https://lmsresources.labormarketinfo.com/charts/unemployment_rate.html\">&nbsp;2.6%</a>&nbsp;in April. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The Florida Policy Institute,&nbsp;a nonprofit policy research group, estimates that without undocumented workers, the state's most labor-intensive industries would \"lose 10 percent of their workforce and the wages they contribute along with them.\" That could lead to a drop of<a href=\"https://www.floridapolicy.org/posts/florida-hb-1617-sb-1718-potential-economic-and-fiscal-impact\">&nbsp;$12.6 billion</a>&nbsp;in Florida's GDP in a single year — about 1.1%&nbsp;—&nbsp;which would, in turn, cut workers' spending power and reduce state and local tax revenue. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> There's been a wave of videos on social media showing images of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@gilbertoalvolante/video/7233761424504261931?embed_source=71223855%2C121331973%2C120811592%2C120810756%3Bnull%3Bembed_card_play&amp;refer=embed&amp;referer_url=www.newsweek.com%2Fvideo-abandoned-florida-construction-site-anti-immigration-law-1800804&amp;referer_video_id=7233761424504261931\">vacant construction sites&nbsp;</a>and fruit and vegetable fields where harvests remain unpicked and are rotting. According to the videos' narrators, the job sites have been abandoned by people who fear the new bill's E-Verify requirements. </p><figure class=\"fig-img\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img   \" src=\"https://chronopin.blob.core.windows.net/thumb/fcbcaef0-59d4-4202-a742-581058a0f2d7-chrono-lg.webp\" alt=\"Samuel Vilchez Santiago, Florida director of the American Business Immigration Coalition, says the law's E-Verify mandate will likely have a significant impact on Florida's agriculture, construction and hospitality sectors.\" height=\"665\" width=\"1000\"><figcaption class=\"fig-cap\">Samuel Vilchez Santiago, Florida director of the American Business Immigration Coalition, says the law's E-Verify mandate will likely have a significant impact on Florida's agriculture, construction and hospitality sectors.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"paragraph\"> While it's difficult to corroborate the videos, immigrant rights advocates say they've been overwhelmed by people asking if they should continue to show up for work. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> \"We have heard from a lot of families who have a lot of questions,\" Evelyn Wiese, a litigation attorney for Americans for Immigrant Justice, told NPR. \"The problem with these kinds of laws is that they attack folks in so many different ways. And because they're often very unclear when they first come out, they really do inspire huge levels of fear.\" </p><h3>Enforcing the hiring rule</h3><p class=\"paragraph\"> What the law says: </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Florida's Department of Economic Opportunity will be responsible for enforcing the E-Verify requirement, and DeSantis has touted new, harsh penalties for employers who violate it. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.flgov.com/2023/05/10/governor-ron-desantis-signs-strongest-anti-illegal-immigration-legislation-in-the-country-to-combat-bidens-border-crisis/\">graphic on the governor's website</a>&nbsp;states that employers who fail to use E-Verify will be fined $1,000 a day. For workers, it will be a felony to use a false ID to get a job. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> What the potential impacts are: </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> But a closer look at the legislation clarifies that these penalties apply&nbsp;only&nbsp;after an employer fails to use the database three or more times within two years. In those instances, the DEO can also suspend applicable business licenses until the employer provides proof of compliance. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> As well, the agency \"does not have a robust enforcement section,\" according to the Florida Policy Institute, and creating new positions to oversee the provisions would result in significant costs. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The<a href=\"https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa775_1.pdf\">&nbsp;CATO Institute</a>, a libertarian think tank, found that other states, including Arkansas and Arizona, which have passed similar E-Verify mandates, are \"widely ignoring the mandate.\" </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> In Arizona, two-time offenders of the law faced the permanent revocation of the employer's license at the location in question, essentially shutting it down for good. But as of 2015 — seven years after E-Verify became mandatory in 2008 — prosecutors had charged only three businesses, according to the study. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The study also found that the&nbsp;E-Verify requirement doesn't achieve what lawmakers set out to do: It doesn't significantly decrease&nbsp;the employment of unauthorized workers nor&nbsp;deter unlawful immigration. One reason is that people who are undocumented often work under the table to avoid a paper trail altogether. Another is that E-Verify doesn't match against death records, so some people are able to dupe the system by using Social Security numbers belonging to deceased people. </p><h3>Redefining human smuggling</h3><p class=\"paragraph\"> What the law says: </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Under the new law, a person who transports into Florida someone they know (or should have known) is an immigrant who has not been \"inspected\" by authorities could be charged with a felony for human smuggling. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> A person who is found transporting fewer than five immigrants on their first offense could be charged with a third-degree felony. They can be sentenced to up to five years in prison per person or pay a fine of $5,000 per count, with penalties increasing dramatically for a subsequent offense or for transporting more people or children. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> What the potential impacts are: </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> This provision was among the most hotly contested and will likely face strong legal challenges because it's so poorly written, attorney Evelyn Wiese told NPR. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> \"As someone who has practiced immigration law for many years, I'm not exactly sure what the law means by 'inspected,'\" she said. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Wiese noted that the Republican lawmakers failed to define the term in the Florida bill and that it deviates from federal immigration laws. Without clarification, she said, legislators have created a situation that could lead to tens of thousands of people being falsely arrested and possibly detained. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> \"That's causing a lot of fear for mixed-status families, for mixed-status groups of friends,\" Wiese added. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The Florida Policy Institute estimates that there are 130,000 U.S. citizens in Florida&nbsp;who are married to undocumented immigrants. It is conceivable that under the law, a U.S.-born spouse traveling from out of state could be charged with a third-degree felony for transporting their husband or wife into Florida. Similarly, farmworkers who travel together or with family could also be charged. </p>",

    "title": "Russia axes landmark Ukraine grain deal just hours before deadline",
    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> Russia on Monday said it had suspended a humanitarian corridor to deliver key Ukrainian grains to global markets, hours before the agreement’s expiry. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> First signed in July 2022, the U.N.-brokered&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/black-sea-grain-initiative\" target=\"_blank\">Black Sea Grain Initiative</a>&nbsp;has been repeatedly extended in short increments, amid increasing discontent from Russia over perceived restrictions that limit the full dispatch of its own grain and fertilizer exports. Russian head of state&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/vladimir-putin/\">Vladimir Putin</a>&nbsp;reiterated these complaints over a weekend call with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, saying — according to a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://kremlin.ru/events/president/news/71680\" target=\"_blank\">Google-translated report</a>&nbsp;from the Kremlin — that the key objective of supplying grain to countries in need, including those on the African continent, had not been achieved under the Black Sea Grain Initiative. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The deal was set up to abate a global food crisis, after Moscow launched&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/17/russia-ukraine-live-updates.html\">a full-scale invasion</a>&nbsp;of fellow key grain exporter and neighbor Ukraine. It was set to lapse on Monday at midnight, Istanbul time. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> “The Black Sea agreements ceased to be valid today. As the President of the Russian Federation said earlier, the deadline is July 17. Unfortunately, the part relating to Russia in this Black Sea agreement has not been implemented so far. Therefore, its effect is terminated,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, in Google-translated comments reported by Russian state news agency Tass on Monday. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Moscow has officially notified Ankara, Kyiv and the U.N. secretariat that it opposed extending the initiative, Tass cited Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova as saying on a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://t.me/tass_agency/201302\" target=\"_blank\">Google-translated Telegram post</a>&nbsp;of the news organization. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> “Only if concrete results are received, not promises and assurances, will Russia be ready to consider resuming the ‘deal,’” the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MIDRussia/posts/pfbid02mEkSdu6n66ECh484Hgukho2WggfB6Prq11Z1WvYQbNJCCTrrdtoXUKNeRmSBgBTyl\" target=\"_blank\">Monday statement on Facebook</a>, according to a Google translation. It stressed that the agreement expires on July 18 and was only “directed to serve the narrow self-interests” of Kyiv and its Western allies. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Peskov said that Moscow’s objection to prolonging the grain deal was communicated even before an explosion on a Crimean bridge that reportedly killed two and halted traffic — which Russian-backed officials have called a “terrorist attack” and blamed on Ukraine. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The European Union has condemned the Kremlin’s withdrawal from the agreement. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> “I strongly condemn Russia’s cynical move to terminate the Black Sea Grain Initiative, despite UN &amp; Türkiye’s efforts,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Twitter on Monday. “EU is working to ensure food security for the world’s vulnerable.” </p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a>Wheat’s at stake</h2><p class=\"paragraph\"> Wheat prices jumped 3.5% as the news broke. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> “Ukraine will now be forced to export most of its grains and oilseeds through its land borders and Danube ports. This will significantly drive up transportation costs and pile further pressure on Ukrainian farmers’ profits. The knock-on effect of this is it could prompt them to plant less next season, placing further pressure on supplies going forward,” said Carlos Mera, head of the agri commodities markets at Rabobank, in emailed comments. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Simon Evenett, a professor of international trade and economic development at the University of St. Gallen, said that Russia’s announcement is the “coup de grace on a deal that was on its last legs.” </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> “Shipments have been falling steadily this year,” he added. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The grain pact allowed the export of commercial food and fertilizer supplies, including ammonia, from three Ukrainian ports on the Black Sea – Odesa, Chornomorsk and Pivdennyi, previously known as Yuzhny. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Cargo ships proceed through the agreed humanitarian corridor to Istanbul, one of the busiest ports of Turkey, whose administration under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been deeply immersed in the negotiations. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Following the announcement, Erdogan on Monday expressed his belief that his Kremlin counterpart Putin wants to continue the Black Sea Grain Initiative, hailing the agreement as a diplomatic success, according to a Google translation of comments reported by Turkish state news agency Anadolu on Telegram.

    "description": "<h2>USB-C</h2><p class=\"paragraph\"> Apple is swapping the Lightning port on the iPhone 15 devices for a USB-C port, which will allow it to comply with new regulations implemented in Europe. These regulations require Apple to produce iPhones with USB-C ports in Europe. </p><figure class=\"fig-img\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img   \" src=\"https://chronopin.blob.core.windows.net/thumb/8ac78eb5-81a9-4d2e-a3b7-ffc1d34f4841-chrono-lg.webp\" alt=\"Apple is swapping the Lightning port on the iPhone 15 devices for a USB-C port\" height=\"563\" width=\"1000\"><figcaption class=\"fig-cap\">Apple is swapping the Lightning port on the iPhone 15 devices for a USB-C port</figcaption></figure><h3>USB-C Data Transfer Speeds</h3><p class=\"paragraph\"> The iPhone 15 Pro models with USB-C ports will&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/16/iphone-15-high-speed-data-transfer/\">support higher-speed data transfers</a>, while the standard iPhone 15 models will continue to feature USB 2.0 speeds, the same as Lightning, giving the Pro models an edge. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> According to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the iPhone 15 Pro models will support \"at least\" USB 3.2 or Thunderbolt 3. With the upgrade, iPhone 15 Pro models would be able to transfer video and other file types at much quicker speeds. USB 2.0 transfer speeds are limited to 480Mb/s, while USB 3.2 supports speeds up to 20Gb/s. If Apple offers Thunderbolt 3 support for the iPhone 15 Pro models, data transfer speeds could be up to 40Gb/s. </p><h2>Pill-and-hole cutout will expand to the entire lineup</h2><p class=\"paragraph\"> Rumors suggest the iPhone 15 models&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/07/face-id-dual-hole-design-iphone-14-pro/\">will look similar</a>&nbsp;to the iPhone 14 models, but the pill-and-hole cutout will expand to the entire lineup. That means&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/05/10/all-iphone-15-models-pill-and-hole-rumor/\">all iPhone 15 models</a>&nbsp;will have no notch, instead adopting the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/12/the-macrumors-show-ross-young/\">Dynamic Island</a>&nbsp;introduced in the iPhone 14 Pro models. </p><figure class=\"fig-img\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img   \" src=\"https://chronopin.blob.core.windows.net/thumb/6638b21e-0ba5-4ae5-92f3-0c24a91af59a-chrono-lg.webp\" alt=\"iPhone 15&nbsp;pill-and-hole cutout will expand to the entire lineup\" height=\"563\" width=\"1000\"><figcaption class=\"fig-cap\">iPhone 15&nbsp;pill-and-hole cutout will expand to the entire lineup</figcaption></figure><h2>Camera Updates</h2><p class=\"paragraph\"> Apple is expected to adopt Sony's latest \"state of the art\"&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/28/iphone-15-sony-image-sensor/\">image sensors</a>&nbsp;for the iPhone 15 models. Compared to standard sensors, Sony's image sensor doubles the saturation signal in each pixel, allowing it to capture more light to cut down on underexposure and overexposure. The sensor will allow for improvements in portraits and other images even when strong backlighting is an issue. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Sony is using semiconductor architecture that puts photodiodes and transistors in separate layers, allowing for more photodiodes. It is not clear if all of the iPhone 15 models will use the new sensor technology, or if Apple will limit it to the higher-end \"Pro\" iPhone 15 models. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus models&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/14/iphone-15-and-15-plus-48mp-camera/\">could adopt</a>&nbsp;the 48-megapixel camera that was introduced in the iPhone 14 Pro models, according to analyst Jeff Pu. The updated lens has a sensor that captures more light for improved image quality. </p><h3>Periscope Zoom Lens Technology for iPhone 15 Pro Max</h3><p class=\"paragraph\"> You've probably heard rumors about Apple's plan to adopt a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/periscope-lens/\">periscope zoom lens</a>&nbsp;for the iPhone 15, but it will be limited to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/14/periscope-lens-iphone-15-pro-max-kuo/\">larger-sized iPhone 15 Pro Max</a>. The iPhone 15 Pro will get a standard zoom lens, and the iPhone 15 models will be limited to the Wide and Ultra Wide lenses. </p><figure class=\"fig-img\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img   \" src=\"https://chronopin.blob.core.windows.net/thumb/a43c8a48-0149-441e-98f3-b24358cfa680-chrono-lg.webp\" alt=\"Periscope Zoom Lens Technology for iPhone 15 Pro Max\" height=\"450\" width=\"800\"><figcaption class=\"fig-cap\">Periscope Zoom Lens Technology for iPhone 15 Pro Max</figcaption></figure><p class=\"paragraph\"> Periscope lens technology offers optical zoom capabilities that exceed those possible with a standard telephoto lens, allowing for 5x or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/03/iphone-15-pro-periscope-lens-rumor/\">even 10x optical zoom</a>. With a periscope lens, the iPhone's zoom capabilities would be significantly enhanced as the current Pro models are limited to 3x zoom. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> With a periscope lens, light is reflected by an angled mirror toward the image sensor in the camera. The directional shift allows for a \"folded\" telephoto lens system for improved optical zoom capabilities without the blurriness that comes with digital zoom. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Apple competitor Samsung has come out with smartphones that use periscope lens technology that enables 4x to 10x optical zoom and up to 100x digital zoom. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes that Apple will implement&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/14/periscope-lens-iphone-15-pro-max-kuo/\">6x optical zoom technology</a>&nbsp;when it adopts the periscope lens. </p><h2>A-Series Chips</h2><p class=\"paragraph\"> The iPhone 15 Pro models are expected to be the first to feature an A-series chip built on Apple supplier TSMC's next-generation 3-nanometer node. 3nm chip technology is expected to increase processing performance by 10 to 15 percent, while also reducing power consumption by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/30/iphone-15-pro-a17-bionic-battery-life/\">up to 35 percent</a>. </p><figure class=\"fig-img\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img   \" src=\"https://chronopin.blob.core.windows.net/thumb/7ea3c303-fa60-4909-a4f0-e37e0e75728b-chrono-lg.webp\" alt=\"A-series chip built on Apple supplier TSMC's next-generation 3-nanometer node\" height=\"563\" width=\"1000\"><figcaption class=\"fig-cap\">A-series chip built on Apple supplier TSMC's next-generation 3-nanometer node</figcaption></figure><p class=\"paragraph\"> The faster chips will be limited to the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, while the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus will adopt the 4-nanometer A16 chip that was first used in the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max. </p><h2>Wi-Fi 6E and UWB</h2><p class=\"paragraph\"> eaked&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/27/wifi-6e-iphone-15-pro-models/\">iPhone 15 Wi-Fi chip diagrams</a>&nbsp;confirm that Apple is upgrading to Wi-Fi 6E, but it is a feature that will be limited to the iPhone 15 Pro models. The iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max will feature Wi-Fi 6E, but the standard iPhone 15 models will continue to use Wi-Fi 6. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Compared to Wi-Fi 6, Wi-Fi 6E offers more bandwidth, providing faster connectivity speeds, lower latency, and increased capacity.

    "description": "<h2>Apple Watch Series 9: Rumored new features</h2><p class=\"paragraph\"> The Apple Watch Series 9 isn’t expected to be a major upgrade over the last year’s models, which featured the introduction of the Apple Watch Ultra with a larger screen, rugged titanium design, and an Action button. According to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1642624542458904576&amp;xcust=1-1-1472709-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/1472709/apple-watch-series-9-rumors-specs-features-price-release.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">a tweet from Mark Gurman</a>, the Apple Watch Series 9 upgrades will be “anything but major,” with the new model “poised for a more modest year.” He adds that Apple is planning “a major update to the watch hardware in 2024, complete with a larger, custom-built&nbsp;display. </p><h3>Action button</h3><p class=\"paragraph\"> Last year Apple introduced the all-new&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1364168/apple-watch-ultra-review.html\">Apple Watch Ultra</a>&nbsp;with a dizzying array of features and components. The newest member of the Apple Watch family featured a more rugged design, flat edges, and a slightly larger display (49mm vs 45mm on the Apple Watch Series 8), along with a surprising new feature: the Action button. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The Action button is located on the opposite side of the Digital Crown and would easily fit on the Apple Watch Series 9. On the Ultra you can set it to trigger specific tasks such as a stopwatch, workout, or flashlight, functionality that would be an excellent upgrade to the existing Apple Watch design. </p><h3>S9 chip</h3><p class=\"paragraph\"> If you look at the tech specs for every new Apple Watch, you’ll see a new chip listed. The Series 8 has an S8 chip, the Series 7 has an S7, and the Series 6 has an S6. The only thing that’s weird is that they’re all the same chip with different names. While the S6 delivered a 20 percent boost in performance over the Series 5, the S7 and S8 are rebranded versions of the same processor according to teardowns and Apple’s conspicuous commission of any sort of performance improvements. But the S9 is rumored to change that, with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1814061/apple-watch-series-9-processor-a15-performance-battery-life.html\">a design based on the A15</a>&nbsp;that brings a boost in performance and battery life, and maybe a Neural Engine built into the chip. </p><h3>Dual-Frequency GPS&nbsp;</h3><p class=\"paragraph\"> Like the iPhone 14 Pro, the Apple Watch Ultra upgraded its GPS to include the L5 band in addition to the standard L1 for faster and more precise location tracking. Even if you’re not hiking in steep terrain, the extra band would be handy in busy city areas where the standard Watch can struggle. Apple has a habit of introducing new features on high-end models and then trickling them down to the lower-end models, and we think that very well could happen here. </p><h3>5G</h3><p class=\"paragraph\"> Thus far, Apple Watches are one of the few remaining Apple devices that hasn’t been updated to 5G—even the high-end Apple Watch Ultra has 4G LTE. With the Apple Watch moving closer toward complete independence, having the fastest connection available seems like a good idea<i>.</i> </p><h2>Apple Watch Series 9: watchOS 10</h2><p class=\"paragraph\"> One thing we know for sure about the Apple Watch Series 9 is that it will ship with watchOS 10. Like always, you can expect a few new watch faces—possibly a couple that are exclusive to the new model—and a new feature or two. However, this year’s update could be more substantial than usual.

    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> Apple is likely to release a USB-C charging case for AirPods Pro alongside the launch of the iPhone 15 lineup this fall, according to&nbsp;Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Writing in his latest&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-07-02/apple-airpods-plans-hearing-test-body-temperature-cheaper-models-usb-c-ljlfwffu\">Power On newsletter</a>, Gurman said the shift was in line with the same switch from Lightning to USB-C that is expected to happen across the iPhone 15 series this year. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reported in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/24/airpods-pro-2-usb-c-later-this-year/\">March</a>&nbsp;that Apple would release a second-generation AirPods Pro with a USB-C charging case later this year. Kuo said it was unclear if any other hardware changes are planned for AirPods Pro in 2023.

It’s not actually Mortal Kombat 12 and is instead setting back the clock all the way back, hence the name. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Fire God Liu Kang wound back time in Mortal Kombat 11 and its Aftermath DLC, which are seemingly somewhat vital to understanding why Mortal Kombat 1 is a reboot. It appears as though Liu Kang is taking Raiden’s godly role and Kung Lao will be taking Liu Kang’s role as the chosen one. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The trailer shows Shang Tsung bringing chaos to the realm, which prompts “war with a god.” The story will be told through NetherRealm’s “genre-defining” campaign that features a cinematic narrative and “unexpected twists on classic rivalries and original backstories.” </p>",

    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Cs809N-BUJ7/\">Mark Zuckerberg just announced</a>&nbsp;Meta Quest 3, our next-generation virtual and mixed reality headset, which launches later this year. It features higher resolution, stronger performance, breakthrough&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/mixed-reality-definition-passthrough-scene-understanding-spatial-anchors/\">Meta Reality</a>&nbsp;technology, and a slimmer, more comfortable form factor. Quest 3 will ship in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.meta.com/help/orders-and-returns/articles/quest-2-supported-countries/\">all countries where Meta Quest is currently supported</a>&nbsp;this fall. The 128GB headset starts at $499.99 USD, and we’ll offer an additional storage option for those who want some extra space. Mark your calendars because we’ll have lots more to share at Meta Connect, which returns this year on September 27. </p><h2>Our Most Powerful Headset Yet</h2><p class=\"paragraph\">  Quest 3 combines our highest resolution display and pancake optics to make content look better than ever. To power those extra pixels, this will be the first headset to feature a next-generation Snapdragon chipset developed in collaboration with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.qualcomm.com/home\">Qualcomm Technologies</a>. That next-gen Snapdragon chipset delivers more than twice the graphical performance as the previous generation Snapdragon GPU in Quest 2 — meaning you’ll get smoother performance and incredibly crisp details in immersive games.&nbsp;  </p><h2>Immersive VR + Breakthrough Meta Reality in a Single Device</h2><p class=\"paragraph\">  On Quest 3, our best-in-class Meta Reality technology lets you seamlessly blend your physical world with the virtual one. These new experiences go beyond today’s mixed reality by intelligently understanding and responding to objects in your physical space and allowing you to navigate that space in natural, intuitive ways that were nearly impossible before. High-fidelity color Passthrough, innovative machine learning, and spatial understanding let you interact with virtual content and the physical world simultaneously, creating limitless possibilities to explore. Now you can play a virtual board game on your kitchen table with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3634830803298285/\"><i>Demeo</i></a>, decorate your living room with virtual art courtesy of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3106117596158066/\"><i>Painting VR,</i></a>&nbsp;or dive into a fully immersive world to do things that are simply not possible otherwise.&nbsp;  </p><p class=\"paragraph\">  Quest 3 makes Meta Reality available to even more people and at a lower price point, making it our first mass-market offering to deliver both cutting-edge VR and MR experiences in a single device, setting a new benchmark for future headsets.  </p><h2>Redesigned for Comfort + Control</h2><p class=\"paragraph\">  With a 40% slimmer optic profile* compared to Quest 2, Quest 3 is a sleeker, more comfortable headset. We also completely redesigned Quest 3’s Touch Plus controllers with a more streamlined and ergonomic form factor. Thanks to our advances in tracking technology, we’ve dropped the outer tracking rings so the controllers feel like a more natural extension of your hands and take up less space. We also included TruTouch haptics that first debuted in Touch Pro to help you feel the action like never before. You can even upgrade to our fully self-tracked&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.meta.com/quest/accessories/quest-touch-pro-controllers-and-charging-dock/\">Meta Quest Touch Pro Controllers</a>&nbsp;for a premium experience. And hand tracking will be supported out of the box, so you can explore without controllers, thanks to Direct Touch that lets you use just your hands to interact with virtual objects.  </p><h2>World’s Best Library of Immersive Content</h2><p class=\"paragraph\">  Quest 3 is compatible with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.meta.com/quest/products/quest-2/\">Quest 2</a>&nbsp;catalog of over 500 VR games, apps, and experiences (and counting), and we’ve got even more exciting new VR and MR titles lined up for launch. That means Quest 3 will have the world’s best library of immersive experiences on day one. Be sure to tune in to today’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC766vkQw0Mz3VtXX5XvXxGQ\">Meta Quest Gaming Showcase</a>&nbsp;for a rundown of new games and updates coming to the Quest Platform — plus a sneak peek at Quest 3’s AAA flagship adventure.  </p><h2>Quest 2 Gets New Lower Prices, Plus a Performance Upgrade</h2><p class=\"paragraph\">  We’re excited for Quest 3 and look forward to sharing more later this year at Connect. But what about Quest 2?  </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> <a href=\"https://www.meta.com/quest/products/quest-2/\">Meta Quest 2</a>&nbsp;changed the face of VR when it first hit the scene in 2020, ushering in a new era of gaming, fitness, and more. It’s already one of the most affordable ways to get into VR — and it’s about to get even better. Starting June 4, we’re lowering the price of Quest 2 to $299.99 USD for the 128GB SKU and $349.99 USD for the 256GB SKU, helping even more people access the magic of all-in-one VR and our vast content library. </p><p class=\"paragraph\">  But that’s not all! In an upcoming software update, we’re updating the Quest 2 and Quest Pro GPU and CPU. Quest 2 and Pro will see an up-to 26% CPU performance increase with an up-to 19% GPU speed increase for Quest 2 and 11% for Quest Pro. As developers take advantage of these changes, you can expect smoother gameplay, a more responsive UI, and richer content on both headsets. And we’re enabling Dynamic Resolution Scaling for both Quest 2 and Quest Pro, so games and apps can take advantage of increased pixel density without dropping frames.  </p><p class=\"paragraph\">  While Quest 3 sets a new standard for mixed reality, immersive gaming, and what a mainstream VR headset can be, Quest 2 remains our most affordable entry point to VR and Pro is optimized for work use cases, with face and eye tracking for more authentic self-expression in meetings. We’ll continue to sell Quest 2 and Pro alongside Quest 3, as well as continue shipping new software updates to make the Quest experience even better.  </p><p class=\"paragraph\">  From games, to fitness apps, professional collaboration tools and more, Quest has something for everyone. And we can’t wait to welcome even more people to the Meta Quest community.  </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> <chronodollar class=\"chrono-dollar-highlight\">$META</chronodollar> </p>",

    "title": "A slim, high performance 16\" laptop with a fully reconfigurable input system and modular, upgradeable graphics.",
    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> We’re excited to share our next major product category, a high-performance 16” notebook, the Framework Laptop 16. Not only does the Framework Laptop 16 carry forward all of the same design philosophy around upgrade, repair, and customization from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://frame.work/products/laptop-diy-13-gen-amd\">Framework Laptop 13</a>&nbsp;at a substantially higher performance point, but it also brings in two new module ecosystems: a fully reconfigurable input deck and modular, upgradeable graphics. This enables an incredible range of use cases and deep personalization for gamers, creators, engineers, and more. We’ll be sharing full specifications, pricing, and availability when we open pre-orders on the Framework Laptop 16 this spring, ahead of shipments in late 2023. [Edit: We've updated this to Summer 2023, and we've kicked off a series of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://frame.work/blog/framework-laptop-16-deep-dive---display\">Deep Dives</a>&nbsp;detailing each subsystem in the Framework Laptop 16.] For more updates on our Framework Laptop 16 development journey, you can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=LNYsui&amp;g=KBVjjZ\" target=\"_blank\">sign up for our newsletter</a>. What we’re releasing today is a preview to let developers get started with our open source design documentation. </p><figure class=\"fig-img\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img   \" src=\"https://chronopin.blob.core.windows.net/thumb/b1da879f-babb-4a28-899f-657b6d229105-chrono-lg.webp\" alt=\"Remove all the Expansion Cards\" height=\"444\" width=\"592\"><figcaption class=\"fig-cap\">Remove all the Expansion Cards</figcaption></figure><p class=\"paragraph\"> Input Module system </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> When starting the design of a larger screen laptop, one of the key questions was: Numpad, or no numpad? After performing some market research, we found out there is almost exactly a 50/50 split between people who love and need numpads and people who hate them.

And if Microsoft is saying that there could be some weight behind the rumors, then it could definitely be happening.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> A slimmer PS5 isn’t set to bring in any extra power or features over the base PS5 or more likely the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/news/ps5-vs-ps5-digital-edition\">PS5 Digital Edition</a>. But for those who’ve yet to jump from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/ps4-2018,review-5942.html\">PS4</a>&nbsp;to the PS5, it could be the console to get if you’re not sold on the looks of the existing console or have limited space in your entertainment center.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> So far the PS5 Slim is still only rumored, but we’d be pretty confident it could arrive this year or maybe in 2024. So with that in mind, here’s what we know about the PS5 Slim so far. </p><h2>PS5 Slim release date speculation&nbsp;</h2><figure class=\"fig-img\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img   \" src=\"https://chronopin.blob.core.windows.net/thumb/ec161dd8-297f-4b5e-b095-30c887b11a53-chrono-lg.webp\" alt=\"Image credit: Wyatt Coe Design\" height=\"563\" width=\"1000\"><figcaption class=\"fig-cap\">Image credit: Wyatt Coe Design</figcaption></figure><p class=\"paragraph\"> There’s no official word on a potential release date for the PS5 Slim. But the rumors around it would point towards it arriving at some point in 2023.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The PS5 will be three years old come November this year, so there’s some logic that a redesigned model would come at a time when Sony’s machine has had time to mature and developers are more familiar with the hardware. Familiarity tends to lead to better optimization, which in turn leads to improved performance for less power. And less power means there’s not so much need for cooling on components, and thus they can be packed into a smaller chassis; just bear in mind this is educated speculation rather than any insight we have from Sony.&nbsp; </p><h2>PS5 Slim price speculation &nbsp;</h2><figure class=\"fig-img\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img   \" src=\"https://chronopin.blob.core.windows.net/thumb/7d794b07-644f-4b22-bd05-97e0f2a9b5aa-chrono-lg.webp\" alt=\"Image credit: Wyatt Coe Design\" height=\"563\" width=\"1000\"><figcaption class=\"fig-cap\">Image credit: Wyatt Coe Design</figcaption></figure><p class=\"paragraph\"> <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.413969/gov.uscourts.cand.413969.177.0_1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">According to Microsoft</a>, the PS5 Slim is predicted to cost $400, putting it on par with the PS5 Digital Edition, as the Slim isn’t expected to have a disc drive.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> This pricing would make sense, but we’d hope Sony cut the price further, especially if the company can reduce material costs and it’s making a machine with hardware that’s approaching its third birthday. But Sony has a roster of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/news/ps5-exclusives\">PS5 exclusives</a>&nbsp;and titles that really need the PS5’s power to run well. So in many ways, Sony can easily dictate the price it wants.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The PS5 hasn't come down from its launch price of $499, and has in fact&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/news/ps5-prices-are-increasing-around-the-world-but-the-us-is-safe-for-now\">gone up in other nations like the U.K.</a>&nbsp;where it rose from £449 to £479. So with price hikes a couple of years into the generation — at a time when we’d have expected prices to drop — we can't foresee Sony having the PS5 Slim heavily discounted. It certainly won’t be priced as cheaply as the $299&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/xbox-series-s\">Xbox Series S</a>.&nbsp; </p><h2>PS5 Slim design and specs&nbsp;</h2><figure class=\"fig-img\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img   \" src=\"https://chronopin.blob.core.windows.net/thumb/d142685b-58bd-4e22-92a5-5e2afcc6bcae-chrono-lg.webp\" alt=\"Image credit: Wyatt Coe Design\" height=\"563\" width=\"1000\"><figcaption class=\"fig-cap\">Image credit: Wyatt Coe Design</figcaption></figure><p class=\"paragraph\"> There have been no leaked images of the PS5 Slim so we can only do guesswork here and peruse some&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wyattcoe.com/blog/ps5-slim\" target=\"_blank\">concept renders</a>. But we’d be pretty confident in saying such a console won’t have a Blu-ray disc drive; having one would only ramp up the component cost of the PS5 Slim.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> We can expect the futuristic router-like look of the current PS5 console to be swapped for something more rounded and less ostentatious. A machine in the vein of the PS4 Slim, which dropped sharp angles for more rounded corners and a compact look would make sense.&nbsp; </p><figure class=\"fig-img\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img   \" src=\"https://chronopin.blob.core.windows.net/thumb/4b3f9ac0-dc1b-41af-8c79-6b7a76e1b4b0-chrono-lg.webp\" alt=\"Image credit: eXputer\" height=\"380\" width=\"770\"><figcaption class=\"fig-cap\">Image credit: eXputer</figcaption></figure><p class=\"paragraph\"> Improved cooling systems and engineering could let Sony pack the PS5’s components into a notably smaller box as well. However, more compact packaging could remove the option of adding in a second SSD as you can with the PS5; the process isn’t plug ‘n’ play but it's straightforward enough (see our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/how-to-upgrade-ps5-internal-storage\">how to upgrade the PS5 internal storage</a>&nbsp;guide). </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> In terms of specs, we’d expect them to remain the same as the current PS5 models. The number of USB ports could be cut, again to save on costs. And Sony may find some way of boosting the console's storage to 1TB or offering an even higher capacity console now that PCIe 4.0 SSDs have come down in price. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Improved cooling could see Sony extract a little more performance from the AMD system-on-a-chip but we’d not bet money on that speculation. </p><h2>PS5 Slim outlook &nbsp;</h2><figure class=\"fig-img\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img   \" src=\"https://chronopin.blob.core.windows.net/thumb/8ef7d038-e3cb-478e-86cc-84b005613acf-chrono-lg.webp\" alt=\"Image credit: WhatIfGaming\" height=\"546\" width=\"970\"><figcaption class=\"fig-cap\">Image credit: WhatIfGaming</figcaption></figure><p class=\"paragraph\"> Given the polarizing reaction to the PS5’s design and that it’s by no means a compact machine, a PS5 Slim would be a welcome addition to the current-gen lineup. And such a slim console would track with Sony making slim versions of the PS3 and PS4.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> We’d not expect it to be a big step forward for the PS5. Rather, it would likely slowly replace the current Digital Edition model.&nbsp;Regardless, a PS5 Slim now seems inevitable. It seems not a matter of if but when at this point.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> <chronodollar class=\"chrono-dollar-highlight\">$SONY</chronodollar> </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> <chronohash class=\"chrono-hash-highlight\">#PS5</chronohash> </p>",

    "title": "AMD reveals the new MI300X A.I. chip to challenge Nvidia's dominance",
    "description": "<h2>The MI300X</h2><p class=\"paragraph\"> AMD said that its new MI300X chip and its CDNA architecture were designed for large language models and other cutting-edge AI models. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> “At the center of this are GPUs. GPUs are enabling generative AI,” Su said. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The MI300X can use up to 192GB of memory, which means it can fit even bigger AI models than other chips. Nvidia’s rival H100 only supports 120GB of memory, for example. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Large language models for generative AI applications use lots of memory because they run an increasing number of calculations. AMD demoed the MI300x running a 40 billion parameter model called Falcon. OpenAI’s GPT-3 model has 175 billion parameters. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> “Model sizes are getting much larger, and you actually need multiple GPUs to run the latest large language models,” Su said, noting that with the added memory on AMD chips developers wouldn’t need as many GPUs. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> AMD also said it would offer an Infinity Architecture that combines eight of its M1300X accelerators in one system. Nvidia and Google have developed similar systems that combine eight or more GPUs in a single box for AI applications. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> One reason why AI developers have historically preferred Nvidia chips is that it has a well-developed software package called CUDA that enables them to access the chip’s core hardware features. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> AMD said on Tuesday that it has its own software for its AI chips that it calls ROCm. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> “Now while this is a journey, we’ve made really great progress in building a powerful software stack that works with the open ecosystem of models, libraries, frameworks and tools,” AMD president Victor Peng said. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> <chronohash class=\"chrono-hash-highlight\">#AI</chronohash>&nbsp;<chronohash class=\"chrono-hash-highlight\">#GPU</chronohash>&nbsp;<chronodollar class=\"chrono-dollar-highlight\">$AMD</chronodollar>&nbsp; </p>",

    "title": "Nintendo Switch 2 rumors are starting to pick up pace given the Nintendo Switch is six years old and based on aging hardware",
    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> While far from official, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/news/nintendo-switch-2-rumors-are-heating-up-again-heres-why\">Nintendo Switch 2 rumors</a>&nbsp;are starting to pick up pace. Given the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/nintendo-switch\">Nintendo Switch</a>&nbsp;is six years old and based on aging hardware, it's likely that the Japanese gaming giant is working on a replacement console.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> And that console is likely to be the Switch 2. While Nintendo tends to introduce wholly new consoles for home use that build upon the features and power of their successors. Or go for something completely new (see the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/eon-super-64\">N64</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/use-gamecube-controller-nintendo-switch,news-26032.html\">GameCube</a>&nbsp;years), it has been more iterative with its handheld machines. As such, we’d be rather confident that the next big games machine from Nintendo will be the Switch 2, even if that isn’t the given name.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> We’re hoping to see big improvements in power, an OLED display as standard, and the ability to output in 4K to keep up with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-tvs,review-2224.html\">best TVs</a>&nbsp;you can buy right now.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> So with that in mind, here’s what we think we know so far about the Nintendo Switch 2, as well as what we’d like to see.&nbsp; </p><h2>Nintendo Switch 2 latest news (Updated June 21)&nbsp;</h2><ul><li>Nintendo has confirmed that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/news/nintendo-switch-2-could-be-backwards-compatible-heres-what-we-know\">Nintendo Accounts will transfer to the Switch 2</a>, which could hint that the next-generation console will offer backwards compatibility.&nbsp;</li><li>Ubisoft's CEO Yves Guillemot may have just&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/news/ubisoft-may-have-just-hinted-that-the-nintendo-switch-2-is-real\">hinted at the existence of the Nintendo Switch 2</a>&nbsp;while discussing the soft sales of the Switch exclusive Mario + Rabbids sequel.&nbsp;</li><li>We discuss&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/opinion/the-nintendo-switch-2-needs-backwards-compatibility-but-not-in-the-way-you-think\">how the Nintendo Switch 2 needs backwards compatibility</a>, just not in the way you think.&nbsp;</li><li>Rumors have suggested that the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/news/nintendo-switch-2-needs-this-one-feature-for-me-to-buy-it-at-launch\">Nintendo Switch 2 may not be backwards compatible</a>, but this could be a major mistake for the upcoming hardware.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Nintendo Switch 2 potential release date and price&nbsp;</h2><p class=\"paragraph\"> Given a pair of recent rumors have popped up hinting at and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/news/nintendo-switch-2-could-arrive-this-year-according-to-new-leak\">teasing the existence of a Switch 2</a>, we would cautiously suggest a second-generation Switch could arrive over the next 12 months; it's apparently set to be released around the same time as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/news/ps5-pro\">PS5 Pro</a>.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> While we had originally hoped Nintendo's latest hardware could arrive in 2023, during the company's annual financial report president Shuntaro Furukawa confirmed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/news/nintendo-confirms-no-switch-2-this-year-despite-hardware-sales-slowdown\">there are no plans to release any hardware</a>&nbsp;during the next fiscal year. This means we should not expect the Switch 2 until sometime after March 2024.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> There is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mynintendonews.com/2023/06/18/rumour-nintendo-preparing-a-nintendo-direct-for-next-week/\" target=\"_blank\">Nintendo Direct rumored for late June</a>, but we'd very much not expect to see any Swirtch 2 announcements or hints.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> As for price, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-oled\">Nintendo Switch OLED</a>&nbsp;comes in at $349 / £309 / AU$539. So we would hazard a guess and say a next-gen Switch would sit around that price point, especially if it does indeed make use of an OLED display.&nbsp; </p><h2>&nbsp;Nintendo Switch 2 specs</h2><figure class=\"fig-img\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img   \" src=\"https://chronopin.blob.core.windows.net/thumb/d9d7a2c3-c71f-4d3b-8e66-69549a5559d0-chrono-lg.webp\" alt=\"Image credit: Katarzyna Penar at Lightframes\" height=\"563\" width=\"1000\"><figcaption class=\"fig-cap\">Image credit: Katarzyna Penar at Lightframes</figcaption></figure><p class=\"paragraph\"> We can expect Nintendo to stick with a system-on-a-chip from Nvidia, likely some next-generation take on the aged Tegra X1 chip found in the current Switch. We’d not be surprised if Nintendo got a custom chipset from Nvidia as well, given the success and scope of the Switch.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> But advancements by AMD, as seen with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/steam-deck-review-the-nintendo-switch-for-adults\">Valve Stream Deck</a>, could put Team Red with an outside chance of providing the silicon for a next-generation Switch. But we’d still err on the side of Nvidia.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> In fact, after a chaotic rumor tipping a Tegra chip based on Samsubg's 5-nanometer process node, which was then refuted by the tipster it originated from,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/opinion/id-bet-the-nintendo-switch-2-packs-nvidia-power-heres-why\">we feel that the Nintendo Switch 2 will definitely have some form of Nvidia chip</a>&nbsp;at its heart.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> It would be difficult to guess at potential power or clock speeds. But we’d like to hope that Nintendo taps into enough CPU and GPU power to deliver a next-gen gaming experience.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> There were murmurs of a potential co-processor chip to live in the dock of a Switch 2 or the once-rumored&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/news/nintendo-switch-2\">Nintendo Switch Pro</a>. This extra chip would be used to boost the console's power and video output when docked and connected to a 4K TV. Such a feature would be neat, but rumors around it have fallen quiet.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> On the display side, we can see the Switch 2 going for an OLED panel, much like that of the Switch OLED. But hopefully, a boost in refresh rates would be good, say taking the 60Hz display and boosting it to 120Hz; as seen in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-phones\">best phones</a>. There are no rumors to support this, but we’ve got our fingers crossed.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> However, Sharp, which makes the current Switch displays, has said&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/news/nintendo-switch-2-rumor-is-bad-news-for-the-display-we-hope-this-is-wrong\">it's working on a new LCD panel for a \"new gaming console\"</a>&nbsp;— that could be the Switch 2. If that is the case then it could be disappointing as the Switch 2 may come with more dated screen tech than the Switch OLED. There's a chance Sharp could be referring to another as-yet-unannounced console. But we're a little concerned the Switch 2 might not use OLED panels as standard.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> With&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/news/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom\">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of a Kingdom</a>, there are concerns (at the time of writing) that the current Switch could struggle to keep a smooth frame rate. Early hands-on experiences have flagged a few choppy moments. As such,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/opinion/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-shows-its-time-for-a-nintendo-switch-2\">this could be the biggest sign that we'll need a Nintendo Switch 2</a>&nbsp;sooner than later if we expect future games to keep up with modern resolutions and graphics.&nbsp; </p><h2>Nintendo Switch 2 features &nbsp;</h2><p class=\"paragraph\"> There’s precious little in the way of hints about Nintendo Switch 2's features, but we can apply some educated guesswork.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> If the Switch 2 sticks to the same control scheme as the Switch, we’d like to see it improve the Joy-Cons so they suffer less from potential stick drifting and have analog triggers for more precise control in the likes of racing games. Some tweaks to the ergonomics — if Nintendo does indeed stick with the Switch’s core design — would also be appreciated with the Switch 2.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> And we’d like to see a boost in battery life, as the Switch tends to run out of juice in a handful of hours when running games like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild,review-4239.html\">Breath of the Wild</a>. A bigger battery would certainly help make it a more viable gaming machine for things like long international flights.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> One other feature&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/opinion/the-one-nintendo-switch-2-upgrade-it-really-needs-is-not-what-you-think\">we'd like to see is improved WI-Fi connectivity for the Nintendo Switch 2</a>. It might not be the first upgrade that springs to mind, but better Wi-Fi can be a dramatic upgrade when it comes to things like game streaming or simply downloading games at speed.&nbsp; </p><h2>Nintendo Switch 2 backwards compatibility&nbsp;</h2><p class=\"paragraph\"> One feature we really hope to see in the Nintendo Switch 2 is backwards compatibility, especially given the appetite we’ve seen for such capabilities on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/ps5\">PS5</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/xbox-series-x\">Xbox Series X</a>; hopefully, running older Switch games on newer hardware would result in a performance boost and improved visual fidelity.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Rather worrying, is a new rumor has claimed that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/news/nintendo-switch-2-may-lack-backwards-compatibility-this-could-be-a-major-problem\">backwards compatibility for Switch games might not happen for the Switch 2</a>. That would be a bit disappointing and would need Nintendo to have a stellar launch lineup for a next-gen Switch if it won't rely on its older and established game library.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> We have also argued that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/opinion/the-nintendo-switch-2-needs-backwards-compatibility-but-not-in-the-way-you-think\">backwards compatibility will need to extend to the Switch Joy-Cons as well</a>. Backup Joy-Cons can be an expensive extra for the current Switch, so if they are rendered moot with the Switch 2, that could be rather disappointing, And we’d hope other existing Switch accessories like the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/ring-fit-adventure\">Ring Fit Adventure</a>&nbsp;and external controllers would also be usable with the Switch 2.&nbsp; </p><h2>Nintendo Switch 2 outlook &nbsp;</h2><p class=\"paragraph\"> As explained, it's still early days on these Switch 2 rumors, with not a lot of hard and fast information floating around.

    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> Misinformation around the 2024 election will be rampant as new tools have made advanced artificial intelligence more accessible, according to Eric Schmidt, former CEO of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/\">Google</a>&nbsp;who co-founded Schmidt Futures. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> “The 2024 elections are going to be a mess because social media is not protecting us from false generated AI,” Schmidt told Andrew Ross Sorkin on CNBC’s “<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/squawk-box-us/\">Squawk Box</a>” on Monday. “They’re working on it, but they haven’t solved it yet.

    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> Micron Technology, Inc., one of the world's largest semiconductor companies, today announced plans to build a new assembly and test facility in Gujarat, India. Micron's new facility will enable assembly and test manufacturing for both DRAM and NAND products and address demand from domestic and international markets. </p><figure class=\"fig-img\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img   \" src=\"https://chronopin.blob.core.windows.net/thumb/7dae0e51-535e-4a74-952b-97f5553fa35f-chrono-lg.webp\" alt=\"Micron Integrated Semiconductor Plant Phase 1 and 2\" height=\"563\" width=\"1000\"><figcaption class=\"fig-cap\">Micron Integrated Semiconductor Plant Phase 1 and 2</figcaption></figure><p class=\"paragraph\"> Phased construction of the new assembly and test facility in Gujarat is expected to begin in 2023. Phase 1, which will include 500,000 square feet of planned cleanroom space, will start to become operational in late 2024, and Micron will ramp capacity gradually over time in line with global demand trends. Micron expects Phase 2 of the project, which would include construction of a facility similar in scale to Phase 1, to start towards the second half of the decade. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Micron's investment will be up to $825 million over the two phases of the project and will create up to 5,000 new direct Micron jobs and 15,000 community jobs over the next several years. Under the government's \"Modified Assembly, Testing, Marking and Packaging (ATMP) Scheme,\" Micron will receive 50% fiscal support for the total project cost from the Indian central government and incentives representing 20% of the total project cost from the state of Gujarat.

    "title": "The Hudson Yards represent the United States' biggest megadevelopment in history",
    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\">    The West Side of New York City is in the midst of being transformed. Construction is well underway on Hudson Yards — the largest private real estate development in the history of the United States and the source of a new neighborhood situated between Chelsea and Hell’s Kitchen. Once completed, the site will be home to more than 17 million square feet of newly created space, including a public school and a much-anticipated cultural facility. Here’s an update on New York City’s largest project since Rockefeller Center.    </p><h2>What is Hudson Yards NYC?</h2><p class=\"paragraph\"> Hudson Yards is a 28-acre mixed-use development on Manhattan’s far West Side, bound by 34th and 30th street to the north and south, and by Tenth Avenue and the West Side Highway to the east and west. The development is unfolding in two parts. The first phase, Eastern Yard, is home to eight new buildings, including residential and commercial skyscrapers, public gardens, a massive shopping mall, and the Shed cultural center. Though specific design details have yet to be revealed,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.hudsonyardsnewyork.com/discover/western-yard\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Western Yard</a>&nbsp;will include additional residential, office, and retail space, as well as an elementary school. When both phases are completed, in 2025, the development will encompass more than 18 million gross square feet of built space, with nearly 14 additional acres of open public space. </p><h2>Why is it such a big deal?</h2><p class=\"paragraph\"> Hudson Yards is the biggest private real-estate development in U.S. history. The last development of this magnitude in New York was Rockefeller Center, completed 80 years ago. Once completed, the site’s developers say, it will contribute some $19 billion annually to New York City’s GDP and generate more than $500 million in city tax revenue. It is also expected to host more than 55,752 workers on a daily basis.&nbsp;Even if you don’t live in New York, pay attention: Hudson Yards is seen as a cutting-edge model for the future of so-called smart cities, i.e. those that leverage data to monitor and manage urban areas. </p><h2>How did New York come up with the idea to develop Hudson Yards?</h2><p class=\"paragraph\"> Though proposals for this parcel of land go back decades, surprisingly, much of the groundwork for today’s new neighborhood is the result of New York’s failed bid to host the 2012 Olympic games. Though the effort (and a proposed West Side Stadium) was rejected in 2005, it catalyzed rezoning and the expansion of the 7 subway line. Tishman Speyer won a bid to redevelop the area in 2008, but that petered out as a result of the recession. The project was picked up by Related Companies in late 2009, which later formed a joint venture with Oxford Properties Group. </p><figure class=\"fig-img\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img   \" src=\"https://chronopin.blob.core.windows.net/thumb/1a4fb11b-a06c-4bfd-a7d3-57be1c4a79e0-chrono-lg.webp\" alt=\"Thomas Heatherwick's Vessel is the centerpiece of Hudson Yards' landscaped public plaza.\" height=\"561\" width=\"1000\"><figcaption class=\"fig-cap\">Thomas Heatherwick's Vessel is the centerpiece of Hudson Yards' landscaped public plaza.</figcaption></figure><h2>Who’s the developer behind the Hudson Yards?</h2><p class=\"paragraph\"> Hudson Yards is developed by Related Companies (which developed New York’s Time Warner Center, and counts Equinox plus over $50 billion in real-estate assets in its portfolio) with Oxford Properties Group.

    "title": "China Has a Youth Unemployment Problem; Guangdong Province Spearheads a Plan to Send 300,000 Youth to the Countryside by the End of 2025",
    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\">   Since the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBS) started to publish the country’s monthly unemployment rate in January 2018,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ceicdata.com/zh-hans/china/surveyed-unemployment/cn-unemployment-rate-age-16-to-24\">the unemployment rate</a>&nbsp;for young urban workers aged 16-24 (including migrant workers living in urban areas) over the past five years has increased from 11% in January 2018 to 19.9% in July 2022, then decreased slightly to 18.1% in February 2023.   </p><p class=\"paragraph\">   Combining the myriad unemployment stories posted on social media, anecdotes from college campuses, with our justified distrust of Chinese government statistics, we believe that the youth unemployment rate is far higher.   </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> This labor force is composed of recent graduates from junior high schools, high schools, vocational schools, undergraduate studies, and master’s degree programs, including returning international students to China. According to the World Bank’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/b8644c8a79ee3376b2cd3c16a9f90cc7-0070012022/original/CEU-December-2022-ENG.pdf\">China Economic Update</a>, Special Report on Youth Unemployment (December 2022), about 39.8 million vocational, undergraduate, and graduate students have entered the labor market in the three-year period from 2020 to 2022, and about 11.5 million more will enter the labor market in June 2023. This does not include graduates from conventional middle and high schools entering the job market. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> If the job market in China does not turn around quickly in the near future, there will be at least a few millions of young people between the ages of 16 and 24 — including the well-educated —&nbsp;unable to find employment. Tellingly, the phrase “out of school equals out of work” (毕业即失业) has been making headlines in Chinese media and social media in recent months. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The internet, education, manufacturing, service and entertainment industries, where young people are concentrated, have been hit hard in recent years, with severe layoffs and declining revenues, and job prospects for young people in the foreseeable future are not looking up. For those who do find jobs, job instability may be high. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> From a statistical perspective, youth unemployment does not seem to be much of a concern. Based on the China Census Yearbook 2020, a macroeconomic research report by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pdf.dfcfw.com/pdf/H301_AP202207251576517991_1.pdf\">Orient Securities</a>&nbsp;states that the share of employed people aged 16-24 in the employed population decreased from 14.3% in 2010 to 7.1% in 2020, due to changes in population age structure; the shift in the overall unemployment rate is only 0.07% for each 1% increase in the youth unemployment rate. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> However, high unemployment among the youth could be of grave political concern for the Communist Party. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Compared with previous generations of Chinese, those born after 1990 belong to the most fortunate generation in recent history: they have a better standard of living than ever before, their families have been willing to invest in them, they have grown up with more freedoms and more education, and they generally are full of optimism for the future. Many of them have studied abroad; the cultural trends they follow are heavily influenced by the West, especially the United States. Now, just as their lives seem ready to take off, the course of history may have turned: the good life they are used to may not be getting better; the period they have grown up in may well be a fleeting aberration rather than a sustainable norm. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Unlike the 1989 generation, today’s youth have not grown up with a keen interest in politics. But last November, they were the ones who&nbsp;<a href=\"https://chinachange.org/2023/02/18/hutong-dj-bars-youth-and-unexpected-politics-the-detained-blank-paper-protesters-of-beijing/\">took to the streets</a>&nbsp;across major cities to protest the cruel and foolish zero-Covid policy. We do not know the deliberations within the CCP, but following the Blank Paper protests, the CCP may begin to see young people, besieged by unemployment, as a potent destabilizing force and take more forceful measures in response to this problem. It is perfectly in line with the CCP’s logic of nipping potential threats in the bud and maintaining regime security at all costs. </p><h4>The new “send-down” plan</h4><p class=\"paragraph\"> On February 20, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League held a “mobilization conference for Guangdong youth to aid in high-quality development” and officially announced a plan to send 300,000 youth to the countryside by the end of 2025, with the tongue-twisting title “The three-year action plan of Guangdong youth going to the countryside, returning to the countryside, and rejuvenating the countryside to help the project of high-quality development of 100 counties, 1,000 townships, and 10,000 villages.” There have been&nbsp;<a href=\"http://dara.gd.gov.cn/mtbd5789/content/post_4098581.html\">news release</a>&nbsp;and coverage of this mobilization conference, but it wasn’t until a few days ago, when someone revealed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/whyyoutouzhele/status/1642848766897053696?s=20\">the full text</a>&nbsp;of the plan on Twitter. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The plan consists of three parts: organizing city youth to go to the countryside; mobilizing rural youth living in the city to return to the countryside; and cultivating youth in the countryside to make them stay in the countryside. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The plan to&nbsp;“organize city youth to go the countryside”&nbsp;has three components: </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> 1) Each year,&nbsp;10,000 graduates&nbsp;from colleges in Guangdong are to be sent to less developed parts of the province for two to three years of “voluntary services” to provide talents to “rural rejuvenation.” According to the plan, the young volunteers will assume the positions of Communist Youth League cadres, promoters of rural rejuvenation, and liaisons for young people returning home, and service personnel for formerly rural townships recently redesignated as urban areas. And favorable policies will follow to “encourage and support volunteers to put their roots down.” </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> 2) Each year,&nbsp;1,000 teams of volunteers, consisting of vocational school students, are to go to the countryside during the summer to provide technology know-how to rural enterprises, startups, and government’s key projects and help train locals. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> 2) Each year,&nbsp;1,000 young entrepreneurs&nbsp;from inside and outside the province are to be recruited to participate in the development of townships and villages.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The plan to “mobilize rural youth living in the city to return to the countryside”: Each year,&nbsp;a minimum of 30,000 college graduates&nbsp;will be sent back to where their rural household registrations are. Municipalities and counties will have a system to register local youth who have left for colleges and provide them with internship or job opportunities to incentivize them to return home. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The plan calls for “helping train 30,000 rural-based youth”&nbsp;each year to engage in digital commerce, farming, and cooperatives (合作社), which was a relic of the Mao-era planned economy and is seeing a government-led comeback in rural China. The government will support 3,000 such startup projects each year by providing loans to recent college graduates returning home. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Chinese netizens and commentators immediately dubbed this plan “the new educated urban youth being sent down to the countryside” (新知识青年上山下乡). </p>",

    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> NEWS HIGHLIGHTS&nbsp; </p><ul><li>Investment of up to $4.6 billion will create approximately 2,000 Intel jobs and thousands of indirect supplier and temporary construction jobs.</li><li>The new facility will help meet demand for assembly and test capacity anticipated in coming years.</li><li>Facilities will be constructed according to green building principles and will operate with high environmental standards to minimize carbon footprint and environmental impact.</li><li>Intel’s investment will help the European Union work toward its goal of a more resilient semiconductor supply chain.</li></ul><p class=\"paragraph\"> WROCŁAW, Poland, June 16, 2023 – Intel today announced that it has selected an area near Wrocław, Poland, as the site of a new cutting-edge semiconductor assembly and test facility. This facility will help meet critical demand for assembly and test capacity that Intel anticipates by 2027. Intel expects to invest up to $4.6 billion in the facility, which will have the capacity to expand. When completed, the facility will support approximately 2,000 Intel employees. The construction of the facility is also expected to create several thousand more jobs, in addition to eventual hiring by suppliers. Design and planning for the facility will begin immediately, with construction to commence pending European Commission approval. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Intel’s planned investment in Poland, combined with its existing wafer fabrication facility in Leixlip, Ireland, and its planned wafer fabrication facility in Magdeburg, Germany, will help create a first-of-its-kind end-to-end leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing value chain in Europe. It will also serve as a catalyst for additional ecosystem investments and innovation in Poland and across the European Union. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> “Poland is already home to Intel operations and is well positioned to work with Intel sites in Germany and Ireland. It is also very cost-competitive with other manufacturing locations globally and offers a great talent base that we are excited to help to grow,” said Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger. “We’re grateful for the support from Poland as we work to grow the local semiconductor ecosystem and contribute to the EU's goal of creating a more resilient and sustainable semiconductor supply chain.” </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Mateusz Morawiecki, prime minister of Poland, said, “We are pleased that the largest greenfield investment in the history of Poland is being led by Intel, a Silicon Valley legend known for its innovation. Chips and semiconductors are critical technologies in the 21st century and we are excited to expand Poland's role in the global semiconductor supply chain and help to establish the country as an economic trendsetter.” </p><figure class=\"fig-img\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img   \" src=\"https://chronopin.blob.core.windows.net/thumb/9adbcb5c-be76-45f8-a749-ab86065673e6-chrono-lg.webp\" alt=\"Expanding Poland's role in the global semiconductor supply chain and help to establish the country as an economic trendsetter\" height=\"562\" width=\"1000\"><figcaption class=\"fig-cap\">Expanding Poland's role in the global semiconductor supply chain and help to establish the country as an economic trendsetter</figcaption></figure><p class=\"paragraph\"> Next Building Block of a Pan-European Semiconductor Ecosystem </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Poland was chosen as the location for the new site for several reasons, including its infrastructure, strong talent base and excellent business environment. The new site is also well positioned to work with Intel’s leading-edge wafer fabrication site planned for Germany and its existing leading-edge wafer fabrication site in Ireland. This proximity will enable close collaboration between the three manufacturing sites and help increase resilience and cost efficiency of the European semiconductor supply chain. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Wafer fabrication facilities (also known as “fabs”) create chips on silicon wafers through various advanced chemical, mechanical and optical processes. Assembly and test facilities, such as the one planned near Wrocław, receive completed wafers from fabs, cut them into individual chips, assemble them into final products and test them for performance and quality. The finished chips are then shipped to customers. In addition to completed wafers, the facility will also be able to accept individual chips and assemble them into final products. The facility will be able to accept wafers and chips from Intel, Intel Foundry Services or other foundries. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The well-paid permanent jobs that the facility creates will range from engineers and business support functions to factory operators and equipment technicians. Poland offers a strong technical talent base and several excellent universities with strong engineering programs. This strong workforce and talent base has been critical to Intel’s 30 years of operation in Poland, including its significant research and development operations in Gdańsk, the company’s largest R&amp;D facility in Europe with nearly 4,000 workers. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> A Resilient and Sustainable Semiconductor Supply Chain for Europe </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Recent global disruptions show the critical need to build a more resilient supply chain for semiconductors. Intel supports the European Union’s goal to reclaim 20 percent of global semiconductor manufacturing capacity by 2030 and is investing in a global semiconductor supply chain that is resilient and geographically balanced. Intel’s investments in Poland and in Europe can act as a catalyst for further investments by ecosystem companies and for building and attracting the talent needed to support a thriving European semiconductor industry. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Intel is committed to sustainability and will adhere to high environmental standards across its global operations and its European operations, including at the planned facility near Wrocław. This facility will be constructed according to green building principles, minimizing its carbon footprint and the impact on the environment. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Learn more about Intel’s manufacturing technology and worldwide manufacturing operations in Intel’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/resources/global-manufacturing.html#gs.z6cwkk\">global manufacturing press kit</a>. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Learn more about Intel’s commitment to sustainability on its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/environment/sustainability.html\">Sustainable Computing website</a>&nbsp;on Intel.com. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Forward-Looking Statements </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties.

It is a burgeoning field melding engineering and science.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Nanorobotics refers to the emerging field of designing and building robots whose components are near the scale of a nanometer ((10−9&nbsp;meters) or ranging in size from&nbsp;0.1 to 10&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrometre\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">micrometers</a>&nbsp;and made of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoscopic_scale\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">nanoscale</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">molecular</a>&nbsp;components. </p><figure class=\"fig-img\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img   \" src=\"https://chronopin.blob.core.windows.net/thumb/e3aa4261-d437-4897-a19b-7a90ee43cf9b-chrono-lg.webp\" alt=\"A scale of nanotechnology matched up with other understandable objects.

The agreement encompasses Intel’s expanded investment in the site, now expected to be more than 30 billion euros for two first-of-a-kind semiconductor facilities (also known as “fabs”) in Europe, along with increased government support that includes incentives, reflecting the expanded scope and change in economic conditions since the site was first announced. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Intel acquired the land for the project in November 2022, and the first facility is expected to enter production in four to five years following the European Commission’s approval of the incentive package. Given the current timeline and scale of the investment, Intel plans to deploy more advanced Angstrom-era technology in the facilities than originally envisioned. The Magdeburg site will serve Intel products and Intel Foundry Services customers. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Press Kit:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/resources/eu-news-2022-press-kit.html\">Intel Plans Investments in Europe</a> </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> “Building the ‘Silicon Junction’ in Magdeburg is a critical part of our strategy for Intel’s growth. Combined with last week’s announcement of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-plans-assembly-test-facility-poland.html\">our investment in Wrocław, Poland</a>, and the Ireland sites we already operate at scale, this creates a capacity corridor from wafers to complete packaged products that is unrivaled and a major step toward a balanced and resilient supply chain for Europe,” said Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger. “We’re grateful to the German federal government, Chancellor Olaf Scholz and the government of Saxony-Anhalt for their partnership and shared commitment to fulfilling the vision of a vibrant, sustainable, leading-edge semiconductor industry in Germany and the EU.\" </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany said, “Today’s agreement is an important step for Germany as a high-tech production location – and for our resilience. Intel's semiconductor production in Magdeburg is the single largest foreign direct investment in German history. With this investment, we are catching up technologically with the world’s best and expanding our own capacities for the ecosystem development and production of microchips. This is good news for Magdeburg, for Germany and for all of Europe.” </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Vice Chancellor and Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Climate Action Robert Habeck said, “Today's agreement is a milestone for Germany as a location for innovation and investment, for jobs, resilience and competitiveness. Intel's investment will raise semiconductor production in Germany to a new level and is an important contribution to growing European sovereignty.” </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Intel’s investment will drive significant economic benefits not only in Magdeburg and Saxony-Anhalt, but across the country and throughout the European Union. Along with Intel’s existing wafer fabrication facility in Ireland and its recently announced assembly and test facility in Poland, the new wafer fabrication site in Magdeburg will create a first-of-its-kind, leading-edge end-to-end semiconductor manufacturing value chain in Europe, serving European customers and helping to fulfill the EU’s ambitions for a more resilient semiconductor supply chain. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> “Congratulations to Intel on further expansion here in Germany. Siemens is proud to collaborate with Intel to accelerate the semiconductor ecosystem in Europe. We are a key technology partner for this industry, supporting manufacturers to scale and build more resilient supply chains,” said Roland Busch, president and CEO, Siemens AG. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The Silicon Junction will serve as the connection point for other centers of innovation and manufacturing across the country and region, promoting the development of a broad ecosystem of suppliers and companies across the technology industry. The site is expected to create 7,000 construction jobs over the course of the first phase of the build, approximately 3,000 permanent high-tech jobs at Intel and tens of thousands of additional jobs across the industry ecosystem. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Intel is committed to developing the Silicon Junction in line with its 2030 sustainability goals, including achieving net positive water use by conserving, recycling and reclaiming water, and funding local water projects that help restore more freshwater than Intel facilities consume. In addition, Intel has set goals to power its global manufacturing operations with 100% renewable energy and to achieve zero total waste to landfills. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Germany has world-renowned universities and technical training programs and a tradition of innovation and engineering that have made it home to some of the world’s most successful and admired companies, including many of Intel’s most important customers and partners. As it does in its other major sites around the world, Intel plans to work closely with local universities, research institutions and training programs to further develop a diverse workforce that can make the site successful and help grow the overall pool of innovators, entrepreneurs and visionaries that will advance Europe’s digital and green future. </p><figure class=\"fig-img\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img   \" src=\"https://chronopin.blob.core.windows.net/thumb/47739496-81f6-4093-97d8-5ce763451af4-chrono-lg.webp\" alt=\"A rendering shows early plans for two new Intel processor factories in Magdeburg, Germany.

    "title": "Microsoft Expects the Next Generation of Consoles to Come Out in 2028 - IGN",
    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> In court documents reviewed by IGN, Microsoft said the “expected starting period” of the next generation of consoles is 2028. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> This means the next Xbox and the PlayStation 6 are set to launch eight years after the Xbox Series X and S and PlayStation 5. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The news comes from documents made public as part of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/xboxs-big-activision-blizzard-ftc-trial-has-begun-what-you-need-to-know-and-our-coverage-so-far\">Xbox's big Activision Blizzard FTC trial</a>, which kicked off this week. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> It's crunch time for Microsoft and the Xbox brand, as company leaders are heading to federal court to defend their proposed $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard against the United States' Federal Trade Commission. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The legal battle between Microsoft and the FTC began last December, when the agency&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/ftc-sues-to-block-microsofts-activision-blizzard-acquisition\">announced plans</a>&nbsp;to block&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-activision-blizzard-buy-acquisition-acquired\">Microsoft's enormous $68.7 billion purchase</a>&nbsp;of the company behind Call of Duty, Diablo and Candy Crush. Last week, a federal court in California issued a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/microsofts-acquisition-of-activision-blizzard-has-been-temporarily-blocked-by-a-restraining-order-from-the-ftc\">temporary restraining order</a>&nbsp;requested by the FTC that basically blocks Microsoft and Activision Blizzard's deal for the time being. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> This week's trial will see the FTC attempt to impose a preliminary injunction on Microsoft and Activision Blizzard. If successful, it would mean Microsoft and Activision Blizzard can't complete the acquisition while the FTC's review of the transaction's compliance with U.S. antitrust law is ongoing. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> In documents released today, Microsoft discussed the 10-year duration of its commitment to Sony to release Call of Duty games on PlayStation platforms, should the deal go through. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> “This term would in any case go beyond the expected starting period of the next generation of consoles (in 2028),” Microsoft said. “Thus, Call of Duty will be published on successor PlayStation consoles should one be released during the term of the agreement. The agreement also would ensure that Call of Duty console games are offered on PlayStation at parity with Xbox.” </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> A 2028 release tallies with a previous document in which Sony said it does not expect its next-generation PlayStation to come out until at least 2027. In that document, released in November last year, Sony claimed it expected to lose access to the Call of Duty franchise in 2027. Sony then went on to state by the time it \"launched the next generation of its PlayStation console... it would have lost access to Call of Duty and other Activision titles\". Microsoft’s filing today counters this suggestion. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Microsoft has announced a number of deals with rival video game companies in a bid to convince regulators its Activision Blizzard acquisition should be approved. For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-has-signed-10-year-deal-to-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo\">it signed a 10-year deal with Nintendo to bring Call of Duty to its consoles</a>. However, it has yet to agree a similar deal with Sony, despite drawing up a proposal. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> This Sony proposal provides for continued distribution of all Activision games on the PlayStation platform at parity to Xbox, Microsoft said. Microsoft sent a draft of this agreement in December, but Sony so far has refused to play ball. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Sony has yet to announce plans for PlayStation 6, although&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-wont-share-playstation-6-plans-with-activision-if-microsoft-deal-goes-through\">today it said it won't share those plans with Activision Blizzard</a>&nbsp;if Microsoft's buyout goes through. PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan told the FTC it couldn't give \"immensely sensitive\" information about its next console to a company owned by Xbox. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> <chronodollar class=\"chrono-dollar-highlight\">$SONY</chronodollar>&nbsp;<chronodollar class=\"chrono-dollar-highlight\">$MSFT</chronodollar> </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> <chronohash class=\"chrono-hash-highlight\">#PlayStation</chronohash>&nbsp;<chronohash class=\"chrono-hash-highlight\">#Xbox</chronohash> </p>",

A low dependency ratio indicates that there are proportionally more working age adults who are able to support the youth and elderly. </p><figure class=\"fig-img\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img   \" src=\"https://chronopin.blob.core.windows.net/thumb/4a93abb1-7a9a-4036-90e3-28dfa7041b98-chrono-lg.webp\" alt=\"GDP projections by 2075 ($ trillion)\" height=\"257\" width=\"1000\"><figcaption class=\"fig-cap\">GDP projections by 2075 ($ trillion)</figcaption></figure><p class=\"paragraph\"> Sengupta added that the key to drawing out the potential of India’s rapidly growing population is to boost the participation of its labor force. And Sengupta forecasts that India will have one of the lowest dependency ratios among large economies for the next 20 years. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> “So that really is the window for India to get it right in terms of setting up manufacturing capacity, continuing to grow services, continuing the growth of infrastructure,” he said. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> India’s government has placed a priority on infrastructure creation, especially in the setting up of roads and railways. The country’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ibef.org/industry/infrastructure-sector-india\" target=\"_blank\">recent budget aims to continue the 50-year interest free loan programs</a>&nbsp;to state governments in order to spur investments in infrastructure. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Goldman Sachs believes that this is an appropriate time for the private sector to scale up on creating capacity in manufacturing and services in order to generate more jobs and absorb the large labor force. </p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a>Tech and investments</h2><p class=\"paragraph\"> Spearheading India’s economic trajectory is also its progress in technology and innovation, the investment bank said. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> India’s technology industry revenue is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nasscom.in/sites/default/files/sr-2023-press-release.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">expected to increase by $245 billion</a>&nbsp;by the end of 2023, according to Nasscom, India’s non-governmental trade association.
