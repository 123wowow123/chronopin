Until now though, there was no option to do so. Windows Phone Central has now learned that Microsoft is planning to sell the stand-alone Kinect sensor for $149 beginning on or around October 6. The timing is ideal as it leads well into the holiday season in the US and other countries, making the add-on an excellent gift for those who already own an Xbox One without the next-gen accessory.",

    "description": "When it comes to wireless charging, Nokia can certainly be credited with pushing the useful technology to the masses like no other. Now, in 2014 their next creation, now under Microsoft, is getting ready to grace our desks and countertops. The DT-903 smart wireless charging pad, which still maintains a terrible name, at least makes up for it in features. The DT-903 is unique enough to be called 'smart' and there's a good reason for the designation. We went hands on with the new DT-903 to show you what it is all about in our latest video. Featuring Qi wireless charging, NFC for 'tap-to-pair' and Bluetooth 4.0, the new Microsoft charger not only gives your Lumia power, but it tells you when you need to charge, or even if you have a missed call or text message.",

    "description": "BioLite says that its latest model is more efficient, producing 50 percent more energy than the original version. That allows it to power up the stove’s removable 2600 mAh battery pack more quickly while also powering the onboard four-speed fan too. That fan that not only helps the stove to cook more efficiently but keeps the amount of smoke generated to a minimum as well. The new stove even ships with one of BioLite’s handy FlexLight, a USB powered lamp that helps you cook after dark.",
