    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> With a picturesque waterfront already in place, San Diego will soon have its very own open-air fish market reminiscent of other similar markets around the U.S., including Seattle‚Äôs Pike Place Market. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The plan, spearheaded by County Supervisor Greg Cox, was announced Wednesday. Cox said the Dockside Fish Market at the Downtown Waterfront will set up shop at the Fish Harbor Pier, near Tuna Harbor between the USS Midway Museum and Seaport Village. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> There, the pier will transform into an open-air fish market featuring pop-up canopies, tables and lots of fresh, local catches for sale. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The market will open to the public for the first time on Aug. 2, from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. After that, it will be held at that location every Saturday morning for the next year or so. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> For now, the plan is for fishing boats to pull into the harbor and unload their catches onto the pier, which could include fish, lobster, urchins, crab and whatever else they‚Äôve caught in local waters. The fishermen will have to pay a vendor fee to be able to sell their goods at the market, but that dollar amount has not been set just yet. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Cox said the new seaside marketplace will not only give consumers a great deal on fresh fish, it will also bring business to local fishermen. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> There are still a number of commercial fisherman that are out there, they're working really hard, they're bringing their catch in on a daily basis, they're turning it over to fish markets at a wholesale price,\" said Cox. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> \"This will give them an opportunity to certainly get a higher price than they would at a wholesale fish market. But at the same time, it's going to be a great bargain for the citizens of San Diego. They will know that it's the freshest fish they can possibly get,\" he continued. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Zachary Roach is a partner for the open-air market and says his father, a commercial fisherman, has been catching rock crab for 20 years, yet the wholesale price hasn't changed. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> \"It hasn't fluctuated in giving him more money for the 20 years. But now we can, rather than sell wholesale, we can sell it here for a chunk of money and still be selling it for cheaper than what they would at retail or at a grocery store, so the consumer is getting the better rate too,‚Äù said Roach. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Employees of a nearby seafood market told NBC 7 they support the new open-air concept and hope the fishermen do well. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> As for locals and tourists, many say they‚Äôre looking forward to buying fresh seafood on the harbor. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> ‚ÄúI would totally support it ‚Äì I think that‚Äôd be great to support local fishermen,‚Äù said San Diegan Brandi Skinner. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Gloria Simon, a tourist visiting from Utah, said she‚Äôd certainly check out the marketplace. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs a great idea because I love the Seattle Pike‚Äôs Market,‚Äù she told NBC 7. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Little Italy resident Sarah Johnson said the fish market will likely become one of her go-to shopping spots for seafood.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs convenient just to walk down here and get the fresh fish right off the market and bring it home. I would be a No.1 supporter of that, definitely,‚Äù said Johnson.A proposal to promote the market will be heard for the Board of Supervisors at a July 29 meeting. Meanwhile, Cox will continue to show his support for the open-air fish market in America‚Äôs Finest City. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> \"Seattle is famous for its Pike Place Fish Market,\" said Cox. \"There's no reason San Diego, with its vibrant waterfront, busy fishing fleets and great year-round weather, can't have our own open air fish market.\" </p>",

    "description": "Ever since Microsoft decoupled the Kinect sensor from the Xbox One, the one lingering question was when would they sell it as a stand-alone unit? Offering an Xbox One without the Kinect sensor made financial sense in Microsoft's struggle against Sony, but it does not mean that people may never want to want to buy the Kinect at a later point. Until now though, there was no option to do so. Windows Phone Central has now learned that Microsoft is planning to sell the stand-alone Kinect sensor for $149 beginning on or around October 6. The timing is ideal as it leads well into the holiday season in the US and other countries, making the add-on an excellent gift for those who already own an Xbox One without the next-gen accessory.",

After Skyward Sword offered a slightly more linear, story-driven campaign than most fans were used to, Breath of the Wild readjusted dramatically in the opposite direction. Suddenly you could go anywhere and climb anything in any order you wanted, and goodness gracious was there a whole lot to choose from. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> There are plenty of fair criticisms to throw at Breath of the Wild, with common ones being its lack of traditional Zelda dungeons and items. But what‚Äôs truly impressive is how much it maintained the heart of a Zelda game even as it altered nearly every system around it. To a certain extent, Zelda has always been about exploration and choice, and Breath of the Wild simply leaned into and enabled those aspects of itself above all else, now making the world a place that would react to those choices as well. There‚Äôs just so much to see, so many people to meet and secrets to find hidden throughout this long-since devastated version of Hyrule. </p>",

But what is more interesting, is that Microsoft describes ‚ÄòScarlett‚Äô as a family of devices; meaning we may see multiple pieces of hardware released that year. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> That date may seem relatively close considering that the Xbox One X launched last year but Microsoft is aggressively moving ahead with hardware in the console space to shake up the industry. But what we don‚Äôt know is if this is a brand new set of devices or simply a more ‚Äòpowerful‚Äô Xbox One that is again, fully backward compatible with all the content available today. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Considering how much effort Microsoft has put into backward compatibility, I would expect the Scarlett devices to support current gen games but offer more advanced features and align possibly with Microsoft‚Äôs upcoming game-streaming services. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> As with any leak this far out, timing and plans can change but I was able to verify the information I viewed as being authentic and fully believe that the company is on-track to release the new console in two years. </p>",

    "title": "'Constant Negativity' From Pro Users Led Apple to Develop Modular Mac Pro, Which May Not Ship Until 2019",
    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\">  Apple executives this week made an unusual and surprising announcement, detailing the company's work on an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/04/04/apple-updates-mac-pro-and-more/\">entirely revamped high-end modular Mac Pro</a>&nbsp;that's set to be released sometime after 2017.  </p><p class=\"paragraph\">  No specific information on a potential release date was shared, but&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.osnews.com/story/29755/Some_notes_regarding_the_new_Mac_Pro\">OSnews' Thom Holwerda</a>&nbsp;has shared some tidbits heard from \"people and sources who know their stuff,\" giving a little insight into just when we might see the revamped Mac Pro and why Apple decided to renew its focus on professional users.  </p><p class=\"paragraph\">  Ahead of Apple's announcement, Holwerda says the Mac Pro was in limbo, and Apple wasn't sure what was going to happen to the machine.  </p><p class=\"paragraph\">  Apparently, the negative response to the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, which many complained was not oriented towards pro users, was a major factor. Apple saw a surge of orders for older MacBook Pros instead of the new model, and that, combined with the reaction to the LG 5K display and the \"constant negativity\" from professional users, led Apple to \"double down on professional users.\"  </p><p class=\"paragraph\">  The decision to move ahead with a modular Mac Pro replacement was made \"in recent months\" with development starting \"only a few weeks ago,\" suggesting it's going to be a long wait.  </p><p class=\"paragraph\">  Given a rough estimate of the length of time it normally takes to develop a project, it could be late 2018 or even 2019 before we see the machine.  </p><p class=\"paragraph\">  The decision to go ahead and develop a modular Mac Pro replacement seems to have been made only in recent months, with development starting only a few weeks ago, which makes it clear why Apple said it won't ship this year. I have no idea how long it takes to develop a new computer like a Mac Pro, but I think we can expect the new Mac Pro late 2018 at the earliest, but most likely it won't be until early 2019 before it ships.  </p><p class=\"paragraph\">  Aside from the Mac Pro, Holwerda also believes Apple is working on additional MacBook Pro models sans Touch Bar, and developing other features aimed at professionals, such as pairing the iPad Pro with a Mac so that it can be used as a Cintiq-style drawing tablet.  </p><p class=\"paragraph\">  Apple hasn't shared a lot of detail on the new Mac Pro, but the promised modular design will allow professional users to keep it up to date with new hardware on a regular basis. Apple executives have said the machine will also be able to handle virtual reality software and high-end cinema editing, pointing towards support for higher-end single GPUs, and Apple also plans to ship the machine with an Apple-branded professional display.  </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> <a href=\"/search?q=#AAPL\">#AAPL</a>&nbsp; </p>",

    "title": "Einride Launches a Prototype for Its Driverless Electric Truck T-Pod",
    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> Einride, a startup based in Scandinavia, has just released a full-scale prototype of its fully electric truck T-Pod. With a range of 124 miles and a 20kWh capacity, it is designed to replace small heavy duty fossil fuel reliant trucks on short trips.  </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Without the need for the driver's cab, the prototype looks pretty weird but if all goes to plan there will be&nbsp;200&nbsp;vehicles transporting goods between Gothenburg and Helsingborg in Sweden by 2020. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Once in full operation, the T-pod network made up of these driverless trucks will have the capacity to move up to&nbsp;2,000,000 pallets of goods per year. Einride claims that they may grow the route network across Sweden faster if the trucks work well. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Interestingly the electric truck not only has autonomous capabilities but it also has a remote control mechanism. This allows humans to control the electric truck. The company says this adds ‚Äúhuman flexibility and decision-making‚Äù to the fleet.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The company is developing the entire transport network that includes remote control center and charging stations along the routes where necessary. The tiny trucks fit&nbsp;15 standard pallets&nbsp;making them small enough to also navigate urban areas. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/04/einrides-t-pod-self-driving-transport-ev-gets-a-full-scale-prototype/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Einride CEO Robert Falck explains,</a>&nbsp;‚ÄúWe‚Äôre now at a crucial time for not only the Einride business but for the future of transport. Through technology, we have been able to create a system for the future, but it involves bravery and dedication from people the world over, to accept that change is also their responsibility and put the T-pod system into practice.‚Äù </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The prototype isn‚Äôt exactly what we will see on the roads, the charging system is yet to debut a larger battery capacity. The first production of trucks is expected to be delivered later this year. </p><div class=\"embed\"><iframe class=\"embed-youtube\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DziWGe1zMJo\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen ></iframe></div>",

To counter this challenge, the tower will change shape regularly. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> ‚ÄúBecause it changes shape every few floors, the wind loads go round the building and won‚Äôt be as extreme as on a really solid block,‚Äù Gordon Gill explained to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.constructionweekonline.com/article-13533-tall-order/1\" target=\"_blank\">Construction Weekly</a>. Gill is a partner at<a href=\"http://smithgill.com/\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture</a>, the design architects for the project. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Delivering the concrete to higher floors will also be a challenge. Possibly, engineers could use similar methods to those employed when building the Burj Khalifa; 6 million cubic feet of concrete was pushed through a single pump, usually at night when temperatures were low enough to ensure that it would set. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Though ambitious, building the Kingdom Tower should be feasible, according to Sang Dae Kim, the director of the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ctbuh.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Council on Tall Buildings</a>. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> ‚ÄúAt this point in time we can build a tower that is one kilometer, maybe two kilometers. Any higher than that and we will have to do a lot of homework,‚Äù he told Construction Weekly. </p>",

The fund, to be established and managed by the City of Waukee, will support the development of community projects like parks, libraries and recreational spaces, as well as infrastructure needs. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> \"We're honored Apple is choosing Iowa for the site of its most technologically advanced data center to date,\" said Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds. \"Apple's commitment to innovation and renewable energy leadership mirrors our own. This investment in our state is vital as we continue to develop as a technology hub and grow our workforce.\" </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> As part of its pledge to power all of its global operations with 100 percent renewable energy, Apple said the data center will run entirely on renewable energy from day one. Apple noted it will be working with local partners to invest in renewable energy projects from wind and other sources to power the facility. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Apple said construction on the data center is expected to start early next year, with plans to bring it online in 2020. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Iowa's Economic Development Authority reportedly&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/08/23/apple-new-data-center-iowa/\">approved a deal</a>&nbsp;on Thursday that will give Apple $208 million in state and local tax breaks to construct two data centers near Des Moines. Apple will reportedly buy 2,000 acres of land for the project, allowing for future development in the area. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Apple's plans to open the facility were&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/08/23/apple-new-data-center-iowa/\">first reported</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;The Des Moines Register&nbsp;on Wednesday. Apple CEO Tim Cook&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/08/24/tim-cook-cts-in-cincinnati/\">is in Des Moines today</a>&nbsp;for a meeting related to the data center, Iowa state officials confirmed. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Apple already operates several data centers around the world. In the United States, it has facilities located in Reno, Nevada; Prineville, Oregon; Maiden, North Carolina; Newark, California; and Mesa, Arizona. </p>",

    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\">  As the second largest city in the Jiangsu province, Suzhou is an important economic hub in East China. Reshaping its skyline is the Suzhou Zhongnan Tower, a 103-story tower with office, residences and a hotel. The tower has five stories below grade and an eight-story, long-span podium with ballroom and conference facilities. The top of the tower features a two-story observation deck.  </p><p class=\"paragraph\">  Our team completed the structural design of the original 729-meter-tall Zhongnan Tower in 2014, and the construction stopped after the concrete piles were finished. The tower design was revised in 2019 with the height reduced to 499 meters.  </p><p class=\"paragraph\">  We are providing structural design services to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gensler.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Gensler</a>&nbsp;for the new tower and previously had for the original one.  </p><h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4><ul><li>The pile foundation built for the original tower is fully utilized by the new one.</li><li>The structural system for the new tower includes a concrete core, a mega frame composed of SRC mega columns and belt trusses and outrigger trusses linking the core and mega columns.</li><li>A hollow core with the cross-web walls removed realizes the architect‚Äôs vision of providing seven large atriums. Thickened solid slabs, working as rigid diaphragms, are provided at refuge levels to ensure the stability of the core.</li><li>A key design challenge originated from the substantial gravity and lateral loads‚Äîincluding wind and seismic‚Äîinherent in many supertall buildings. The sturdy foundation system, relying on concrete bored piles with post grouting, can support substantial gravity loads. The core-outrigger-mega frame system provides sufficient lateral stiffness and strength to resist significant lateral loads and satisfies the strict story drift ratio.</li><li>The tower features a unique crystal crown that resembles a four-petal yellow Osmanthus flower. The crown structure consists of eight mega columns at perimeter and the flange walls at center, supporting a helipad and a hanging structure for the tuned mass damper (TMD).</li><li>The top of the tower is designed to meet the H10 requirements of Japanese standards, which means only 10% of people can feel building motion during a 10-year wind event. Our creative solution combines two damping systems, a 300-ton TMD and a tuned sloshing damper (TSD) based on the 1000-ton water tank. This marks the first time this approach has been adopted for a supertall building.</li><li>The TMD is suspended by a unique structural device with multiple hanging masses that can swing in opposite directions, making it more efficient than a traditional single mass damper.</li></ul>",

    "title": "NASA Is Getting Closer to Building An Ultra-Quiet Supersonic Jet for Passenger Flight",
    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> NASA is moving forward with their plans to create a super-quiet supersonic jet. The agency announced last year it was working on the design of the aircraft with Lockheed Martin. In June the collaborative team did wind tunnel testing of its initial demo version and the agency is now ready to accept bids for building a larger ‚Äòreal-world‚Äô version.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div class=\"embed\"><iframe class=\"embed-youtube\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/M7pdza9ctRw?start=4s\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen ></iframe></div><p class=\"paragraph\"> Supersonic travel has not really been possible in the early 70‚Äôs when aircraft speed limit was restricted to under 660 miles per hour. At this speed, a typical-size plane traveling at 30,000 feet breaks the sound barrier and creates a 30-mile-wide, continuous sonic boom. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The idea of the new supersonic jet design is to reduce this boom to more of a hum.&nbsp;According to Lockheed Martin, co-designer of the aircraft this hum should be akin to the sound inside of a luxury car on a highway. The reduction in noise means the plane can fly almost anywhere. The infamous Concorde was limited to overseas flights due to its 90 dBa sound level. &nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The quiet plane will fly up to 55,000 feet at supersonic speeds. The new prototype will run on two engines and in theory, it could cut the flight time from New York to Los Angeles in half from 6 to 3 hours. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> To get the demo plane up and testing will cost NASA&nbsp;$390 million USD&nbsp;over the next five years. The first year of the funding was included in The Republican administration's 2018 budget draft. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> While NASA doesn't have plans to start offering passenger flights, they will share the design for the plane with other US based aircraft fabricators. Which may mean the technology will be available for commercial use.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3_Fb_ngUMw&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Peter Coen</a>, project manager for NASA‚Äôs commercial supersonic research team. Says of the plans to open source the design, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs going to make it possible for companies to offer competitive products in the future.‚Äù </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> It is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-29/supersonic-is-coming-back-will-the-airlines-buy-it\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">expected</a>&nbsp;start-ups such as&nbsp;Boom Technology&nbsp;and billionaire&nbsp;Robert Bass‚Äôs&nbsp;Aerion&nbsp;will be quick to jump on the opportunity. &nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> NASA collaborated with Lockheed Martin to experiment using super computer modeling to map how the aircraft shape affects the supersonic shock waves it creates. The final design stops the sounds waves from the jet from merging the shape and pattern that creates the glass shattering sonic boom. The waves instead are kept dispersed which results in a more palatable hum sounds.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The sound has always been one of the major obstacles to supersonic travel. Other problems include high carbon emissions and airport noise. General Electric is working on other ways to dampen engine sound and NASA has funded an MIT study that will investigate ways to reduce carbon emissions from these high-performance aircraft. &nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The final hurdle might be Washington itself. The legislation that banned the Concorde will require some untangling or complete dissolution to enable the new jet design to fly in US airspace. To get this ball rolling NASA has six test flights planned to fly over populated areas beginning in 2022. If these go well, the problems with the laws may be less of a hurdle. &nbsp; </p>",

    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> In the 87 hours that it took me to beat Elden Ring, I was put through an absolute wringer of emotion: Anger as I was beaten down by its toughest challenges, exhilaration when I finally overcame them, and a fair amount of sorrow for the mountains of exp I lost along the way to some of the toughest boss encounters FromSoftware has ever conceived. But more than anything else I was in near-constant awe ‚Äì from the many absolutely jaw-dropping vistas, the sheer scope of an absolutely enormous world, the frequently harrowing enemies, and the way in which Elden Ring nearly always rewarded my curiosity with either an interesting encounter, a valuable reward, or something even greater. FromSoftware takes the ball that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review\">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>&nbsp;got rolling and runs with it, creating a fascinating and dense open world about freedom and exploration above all else, while also somehow managing to seamlessly weave a full-on Dark Souls game into the middle of it. It shouldn‚Äôt be a surprise to anyone that Elden Ring ended up as one of the most unforgettable gaming experiences I‚Äôve ever had. </p>",

    "title": "Gran Turismo 7 Review - IGN",
    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\">  From the first honk of the series‚Äô iconic countdown klaxon, there are moments during Gran Turismo 7 when it feels almost like a remake of the 1997 original. In the space of a moment I‚Äôm 16 again and stuffing earthshaking turbos into a bright red Mitsubishi GTO, wondering how I‚Äôm going to be able to beat my dad around Trial Mountain when he always gets the DualShock and I have to make do with our only other controller ‚Äì a terrible, translucent blue aftermarket job with no analogue sticks. That‚Äôs a kind of magic a video game series can‚Äôt buy; it can only earn. Gran Turismo 7 has that magic; that compulsive car upgrade loop the series established, plus the hot looks and sterling handling to back it up. But there‚Äôs a lot more to Gran Turismo 7 than the sum of its nostalgia ‚Äì even if there are still a few traditions it should‚Äôve left in its rear-view mirror.  </p><div class=\"embed\"><iframe class=\"embed-youtube\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1tBUsXIkG1A\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen ></iframe></div><p class=\"paragraph\"> Nostalgia isn‚Äôt a requirement, though: Gran Turismo 7 is the most welcoming GT ever, with dozens of hours of curated races and tasks designed to induct a new generation of players into the classic GT experience. GT7 achieves this via the Gran Turismo Caf√©, an eccentric but effective little hub that the developers at Polyphony have placed right in the middle of its world map. When we drop in, the caf√© owner assigns us specific races and tasks via a series of 39 so-called ‚Äúmenu books.‚Äù Working through those gradually introduces new drivers to how things work in GT ‚Äì from earning licences and finding and buying cars, to customisation and racing. Some of it may initially seem like busywork to long-time GT players, but the racing events the Gran Turismo Caf√© deliberately threads us through all make up part of the large list of career races we‚Äôd be otherwise doing anyhow ‚Äì and the decent collection of reward cars offered for working through the menu books makes it well worth your time. </p>",

    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> Like many of developer Supermassive‚Äôs previous games, The Quarry is clearly made both by and for people who love horror movies. From the start, it slowly builds tension and atmosphere, getting you invested by constantly asking you to make small decisions that will guide its teenage cast of potential murder victims. By the time the blood started flying, every choice felt like one more step in a rolling disaster, and that made it nearly impossible to put down. When I went back to replay it again, however, it was impossible to ignore just how non-interactive much of The Quarry actually is. As a spiritual sequel to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/24/until-dawn-review\">Until Dawn</a>, it's a better movie, but a worse game. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> You follow the story of nine camp counselors who get stuck in the woods for one more night at the end of the summer, with nothing to do but throw one last party before they go back to their lives. There's something stalking them from the treeline (because of course there is) and your choices determine which, if any, of the counselors will be able to survive the night. This setup layers three fairly textbook horror plots on top of each other as you progress, but you can tell that Supermassive Games had a lot of fun figuring out how to connect them together. When you play, you may think you're in one type of horror movie, but you're often in another. </p>",

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder‚Äôs Revenge is nothing but unwaveringly reverent to the classic 1989 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Arcade game, and more prominently, 1991‚Äôs Turtles in Time. Best of all, it transforms the arcadey quarter-munching design of combat into something much more skill forward while still maintaining the same button mashy appeal.

But very little is as it first appears, and all it takes to reveal As Dusk Falls‚Äô many layers of storytelling depth is one small,&nbsp;decades-spanning&nbsp;tragedy. And it‚Äôs all about the story, since this is a choose-your-own-adventure-style graphic novel that cleverly pulls ideas from games like Telltale‚Äôs&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/12/12/the-walking-dead-the-game-review\">The Walking Dead</a>&nbsp;series and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/13-sentinels-aegis-rim-review\">13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim</a>. Each member of this voice-acting cast of unique and interesting characters has their own, often conflicting emotional stakes that accelerate the story in seemingly hundreds of logical and intelligently connected directions. Through the powerful and often far-reaching consequences of your own actions, this small town is gradually unveiled as a powder keg full of secrets, vices, and familial bonds that run far deeper than any outsider is initially led to expect. </p>",

    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> A delightful cat-based platforming adventure in a cyberpunk world worth exploring. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Silent protagonists are nothing new in video games, but Stray certainly pushes that concept to an interesting place. Part platformer, part traditional adventure game, this cyberpunk world full of neon-soaked robots transforms into a giant jungle gym from your perspective, which is just one foot off the ground. The concept of putting you in the paws of an average cat may be a silly one on the surface, but Stray uses that furry vehicle to tell a genuinely compelling story with some entertaining action along the way. Not all of its ideas land on their feet, but it was impossible to shake the fuzzy feeling it gave me right from the adorable opening minutes. </p>",

Of course, while this third entry evolves in some key areas that make the epic journey more consistently fun than the two mainline games that came before it, it also repeats some of the same mistakes, including sloppy writing, weak bosses, and graphics that often leave something to be desired. Even so, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is already competing for the spot as my favorite iteration of this beloved series. </p>",

That totally makes sense. But Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope is not that kind of sequel; even though&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/28/mario-rabbids-kingdom-battle-review\">Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle</a>&nbsp;surprised us all with its smart&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/24/xcom-2-war-of-the-chosen-review\">XCOM</a>-style tactics in Nintendo clothing, this followup maintains its best ideas but reinvents itself to the point where it immediately feels very different. It‚Äôs bigger and better in nearly every way, with a more freeform and customizable take on combat and an almost completely rethought overworld that‚Äôs much less linear and absolutely packed with puzzles. The story‚Äôs all over the place and the Switch can‚Äôt always handle everything smoothly, but it‚Äôs a fantastic game that can be played as either an enjoyable cakewalk or a deep, demanding tactical challenge, all while maintaining its zany sense of humor. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Picking back up in the post-Rabbid invasion Mushroom Kingdom, things immediately get even weirder when a giant manta ray from space arrives to cause trouble. The story is actually one of Sparks of Hope‚Äôs few missteps: the original‚Äôs trans-dimensional blending of Mario characters and goofball Rabbids is completely absurd, but it kind of makes sense in its own way. This time, though, the completely unrelated enemy spreads what‚Äôs effectively Ganon‚Äôs corrupt ooze with eyeballs from Breath of the Wild everywhere, and most but not all of her minions are also Rabbids for some reason? Also we have a spaceship for traveling between literal worlds? It makes Kingdom Battle look grounded in reality by comparison, which is something I never thought I‚Äôd say about that game. I wasn‚Äôt expecting deep lore or anything, but it‚Äôs kind of a mess. It does consistently have some pretty good jokes, though, so at least I was chuckling as I was scratching my head. </p>",

It‚Äôs just incredible to look at, feels equally amazing to play, and is jam packed with opportunities for style and creativity thanks to the wide assortment of wild weapons at your disposal. Bayonetta 3 just further cements its legacy, strutting out with a surprising sequel in that it actually takes a lot of risks with changing up its established formula in an effort to revitalize a combat system that only slightly evolved between the first two games. Fortunately those risks pay off. Bayonetta 3 is an invigorated sequel with fresh new ideas that embolden its 13-year-old combat system, an impressive amount of variety throughout its 10 to 12-hour campaign, and more of that trademark sexy Bayonetta style that makes the series one of a kind. </p>",

This is&nbsp;the&nbsp;Call of Duty experience, deconstructed, reconsidered, and obsessively optimized over 15 uninterrupted years of iteration. I know when I'm playing a Black Ops game because it has offbeat arcade modes and the latest iteration of Nuketown. I know I'm playing a Modern Warfare game because the shooting is so finely tuned that I want to take my Gunsmith build out to dinner. Infinity Ward has officially mastered the instant gratification of aiming down sights and deleting targets. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> That goes a long way, though some of Modern Warfare 2's biggest swings, such as revamped progression and a genre-bending campaign, are less elegant. It also suffers from an obtuse UI, fits of crashes, weird bugs, and the unexplained absence of basic features like stat tracking. But altogether, it's a good year for Call of Duty. </p>",

It‚Äôs also unforgiving and unapologetic, with pockets of frustrating moments during which I was certainly not in my happy place.

Your father and martial arts master is killed right before your eyes in what is quite simply one of the best prologue chapters I‚Äôve played in recent memory. It both serves as an excellent tutorial, and a teases at what the future holds for you as you have full access to the entire catalog of unlockable moves. Eight years later, you set off on a journey to kill each of the five people involved. </p><div class=\"embed\"><iframe class=\"embed-youtube\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1FQ1YO3Ks2U\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen ></iframe></div>",

This spiritual successor to the sci-fi survival horror series recreates the haunting blood-streaked hallways and space zombie-slaying hallmarks first established on the USG Ishimura back in 2008, and injects the gore with more awe than ever before thanks to some strikingly detailed splashes of blood and guts. Unfortunately, while the mutant dismemberment has never been more vivid, The Callisto Protocol‚Äôs shortcomings appear just as clearly. Occasional control annoyances, imbalanced combat, and a general absence of innovation result in a roughly eight-hour massacre that‚Äôs gratifyingly gruesome, but never quite as great as the series that inspired it. </p>",

    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> One of my favorite things about watching superheroes duke it out is when someone gets smacked so hard they fly backwards and crash through solid walls, explode tanker trucks, or slam into their friends. It‚Äôs an awesome demonstration of just how strong these godlike characters are supposed to be, and it‚Äôs always a disappointment when a superhero game doesn‚Äôt quite capture that feeling. With Marvel‚Äôs Midnight Suns, however, Firaxis has built a deep and innovative turn-based tactical combat system around the joy of having Iron Man, Dr. Strange, Blade, and more knock enemies around like toys they're trying to break ‚Äì and that hasn‚Äôt gotten old in the roughly 75 hours of its surprisingly expansive RPG campaign. A lot of that time isn‚Äôt spent in battles, though, and while it‚Äôs certainly appealing to get up close and personal with this cast of more than a dozen popular and lesser-known Marvel heroes, it does tend to go a bit overboard with convincing Earth‚Äôs mightiest heroes to all be your BFFs. </p>",

Its open world map absolutely nails the vibe of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, it has spellcasting combat that‚Äôs stupefyingly good, the characters that inhabit it are charming and unforgettable, and it is positively brimming with countless diversions to soak up dozens of hours of your time. It may not be the most impressive technical achievement and it is certainly cursed with a lack of enemy variety, but none of Hogwarts Legacy‚Äôs issues can cast a Descendo charm on this triumphant visit to the Wizarding World. </p>",

    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\"> It‚Äôs a thrill when we get to say this about a new piece of gaming hardware: The PlayStation VR 2 is a true generational leap that makes the old one look like a piece of junk. It‚Äôs not exactly cheap, but for $549.99 you get a high-end headset with a 4K, HDR-enabled OLED screen, a 110-degree field of view, built-in tracking cameras, and eye tracking, plus two of its slick Sense controllers with the excellent adaptive triggers and haptic feedback Sony introduced with the PlayStation 5‚Äôs DualSense controller. The catch is that it requires you to be connected to a PS5 by a single USB-C cable, but that means it‚Äôs much, much more powerful when it comes to delivering fantastic graphics than a self-contained headset like the Meta Quest 2. With all of that, including a few features you don‚Äôt see on even more expensive PC VR headsets like Valve‚Äôs Index and HP‚Äôs Reverb G2, the PlayStation VR2 has vaulted console VR into the lead in just about every category‚Ä¶ except available games. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> <a href=\"/search?q=$SONY\">$SONY</a>&nbsp; </p>",

And now we‚Äôre back, in outer space‚Ä¶ okay, okay, don‚Äôt leave! I‚Äôll stop. The point is that with vastly expanded combat options, bigger, more open maps, vastly more abilities to play with, and enough collectable stuff to fill a Correllian freighter, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is in many ways the Batman: Arkham City to Fallen Order‚Äôs Arkham Asylum.

Even so, when I hit the start button on this 2023 remake of the legendary 2005 action-horror game I wasn‚Äôt prepared for how forcefully it would knock my knees out from under me and suplex me headfirst into 16 hours of sustained tension and exhilaration. This fully revitalised campaign dramatically one-ups the original in almost every conceivable way. Its Spanish countryside setting is substantially more sinister, its pacing has been tightened to the point where hardly a single minute is wasted, and its controls have been modernised in order to allow its signature dynamic shooting mechanics to really shine. I‚Äôve been waiting 18 years for a game to thrill me in the same way as Resident Evil 4; as it turns out, this whole time I‚Äôve just been waiting for another Resident Evil 4. </p>",

    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\">  The last time the so-called ‚ÄúX date‚Äù was updated was on May 1, when Yellen told Congress the United States had enough cash available to meet its obligations until ‚Äúearly June, and potentially as early as June 1.‚Äù&nbsp;  </p><p class=\"paragraph\">  Friday‚Äôs letter marked the first time since Yellen began sending regular updates to Congress in January that the secretary did not caveat the date with a phrase like ‚Äúas early as.‚Äù  </p><p class=\"paragraph\">  Instead, Yellen explained that Treasury would make more than ‚Äù$130 billion of scheduled payments in the first two days of June,‚Äù leaving the agency with ‚Äúan extremely low level of resources.‚Äù  </p><p class=\"paragraph\">  ‚ÄúDuring the week of June 5, Treasury is scheduled to make an estimated $92 billion of payments and transfers,‚Äù Yellen continued, and ‚Äúour projected resources would be inadequate to satisfy all of these obligations.‚Äù  </p><p class=\"paragraph\">  To underscore just how low Treasury‚Äôs reserves had fallen, Yellen said the agency was forced to deploy an obscure measure on Thursday to move $2 billion from a civil service retirement fund over to the government‚Äôs main borrowing institution, the Federal Financing Bank.  </p><p class=\"paragraph\">  The move was necessary because ‚Äúthe&nbsp;extremely&nbsp;low level of remaining resources demands that I exhaust all available extraordinary&nbsp;measures to&nbsp;avoid being unable to meet all of the government‚Äôs commitments,‚Äù Yellen wrote.  </p><p class=\"paragraph\">  Markets&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/25/stock-market-today-live-updates.html\">closed higher</a>&nbsp;Friday, buoyed in part by optimism that there would be a deal passed by the House and Senate and signed by the president by June 1.&nbsp;  </p><p class=\"paragraph\">  But as talks dragged on this week with little more than vague claims of ‚Äúprogress‚Äù by those involved, optimism faded that deal would be reached by the end of Friday.  </p><p class=\"paragraph\">  Officials said Friday was widely seen as the last possible day to reach a deal and still have enough time to craft it into legislation, pass it in the House and then pass it in the Senate before the previous ‚ÄúX-date‚Äù of June 1.  </p><p class=\"paragraph\">  Yellen‚Äôs new date came amid growing concerns around the world about the U.S. credit rating.&nbsp;  </p><p class=\"paragraph\">  On Wednesday, the Fitch credit rating agency announced it had placed the United States‚Äô triple-A status on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/24/fitch-us-aaa-rating-negative-watch-debt-ceiling.html\">‚Äúrating watch negative.‚Äù</a>  </p><p class=\"paragraph\">  <a href=\"/search?q=#XDate\">#XDate</a>&nbsp;  </p>",

The next game in Blizzard's mega-popular franchise was unveiled a good while ago, and its release is drawing ever closer.  </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Diablo 4 is getting a couple of betas to let players test it out before it launches, we found out in February 2023. The first weekend will be locked to those who pre-order the game, while the second will be open to all. Their dates are below: </p><ul><li>17-19 March 2023:&nbsp;Exclusive early access</li><li>24-26 March 2023:&nbsp;Open beta for all</li></ul><p class=\"paragraph\"> The beta will let players try out the entirety of the game's prologue and first act, apparently, and will have a fairly generous level cap of 25. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Diablo 4 has been confirmed as coming for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One and PC. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Although Xbox is trying to buy Activision Blizzard, the acquisition is going slowly enough that we now know Diablo 4 will not be coming to Xbox Game Pass, which is fairly substantial news. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> There is no word on a Nintendo Switch version, which might have something to do with the persistently online game world and graphical upgrades. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> You wouldn't be able to play it offline on your travels, for example - something nigh-on mandatory for successful Switch games. </p><h2>Diablo 4 gameplay</h2><p class=\"paragraph\"> In terms of the gameplay it will be a similar experience to Diablo III, it seems, with a bevvy of skills to use and plenty of gory, bloody combat. The most up-to-date showcase is from Xbox's presentation in June 2022, which you can see right here: </p><div class=\"embed\"><iframe class=\"embed-youtube\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/94wQxtv_sAc?start=169s\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen ></iframe></div>",

But Tesla's compact sedan will get more than that.&nbsp;According to a \"trusted insider\" who offered an exclusive insight to&nbsp;Not A Tesla App, the Project Highland will bring significant changes inside and out.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Starting with the design, the report notes the headlights will have a different shape, which means the front bumper will be redesigned as well. It will be more aerodynamic and will now house a single camera in the center area of the lower grille, in similar fashion to the Cybertruck. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Out back, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://insideevs.com/news/632016/tesla-model-3-facelift-project-highland-spotted/\">refreshed Tesla Model 3</a>&nbsp;is also getting a redesigned bumper, although the changes will likely be purely for aesthetic reasons. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The source also said the side mirrors will be subtly updated and the Project Highland will be getting more cameras to take advantage of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://insideevs.com/news/652740/tesla-autopilot-hardware-4-fsd2-leak/\">new Hardware 4.0 Autopilot supercomputer</a>.

The Adventure Van would harken back to the days when you could roll into your local Volkswagen or Toyota dealer and leave with a Westfalia or Chinook. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> PLATFORM AND POWERTRAIN:&nbsp;Although Rivian could conceivably build the Adventure Van from its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.motortrend.com/news/2022-rivian-prime-delivery-van-first-look-review/\">commercial-oriented Prime Van</a>&nbsp;or RCV, we believe it'll instead use the more off-road-capable platform under the R1T pickup and R1S SUV. Hard details from our sources are scarce, as it's still early days for the Adventure Van, but we believe it will be available with multiple battery and motor options and come standard with the company's trick hydropneumatic suspension. We suspect&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.motortrend.com/news/rivian-r1t-r1s-two-motor-standard-battery-pack-details/\">both dual- and quad-motor powertrains</a>&nbsp;will be available, with as much as 1,200 hp and 1,200 lb-ft on tap, and Rivian's 180-kWh Max battery pack. </p>",

The chip apparently provides ‚Äúgreater compute power and efficiency‚Äù than CPUs and is ‚Äúcustomized for our internal workloads.‚Äù With a combination of MTIA chips and GPUs, Janardhan said that Meta believes ‚Äúwe‚Äôll deliver better performance, decreased latency, and greater efficiency for each workload.‚Äù  </p><p class=\"paragraph\">  The MTIA could be a big boon for Meta, especially given&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/ai-developers-stymied-by-server-shortage-at-aws-microsoft-google\">increasingly high demand for AI compute power</a>.

    "title": "China Has a Youth Unemployment Problem; Guangdong Province Spearheads a Plan to Send 300,000 Youth to the Countryside by the End of 2025",
    "description": "<p class=\"paragraph\">   Since the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBS) started to publish the country‚Äôs monthly unemployment rate in January 2018,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ceicdata.com/zh-hans/china/surveyed-unemployment/cn-unemployment-rate-age-16-to-24\">the unemployment rate</a>&nbsp;for young urban workers aged 16-24 (including migrant workers living in urban areas) over the past five years has increased from 11% in January 2018 to 19.9% in July 2022, then decreased slightly to 18.1% in February 2023.   </p><p class=\"paragraph\">   Combining the myriad unemployment stories posted on social media, anecdotes from college campuses, with our justified distrust of Chinese government statistics, we believe that the youth unemployment rate is far higher.   </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> This labor force is composed of recent graduates from junior high schools, high schools, vocational schools, undergraduate studies, and master‚Äôs degree programs, including returning international students to China. According to the World Bank‚Äôs&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/b8644c8a79ee3376b2cd3c16a9f90cc7-0070012022/original/CEU-December-2022-ENG.pdf\">China Economic Update</a>, Special Report on Youth Unemployment (December 2022), about 39.8 million vocational, undergraduate, and graduate students have entered the labor market in the three-year period from 2020 to 2022, and about 11.5 million more will enter the labor market in June 2023. This does not include graduates from conventional middle and high schools entering the job market. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> If the job market in China does not turn around quickly in the near future, there will be at least a few millions of young people between the ages of 16 and 24 ‚Äî including the well-educated ‚Äî&nbsp;unable to find employment. Tellingly, the phrase ‚Äúout of school equals out of work‚Äù (ÊØï‰∏öÂç≥Â§±‰∏ö) has been making headlines in Chinese media and social media in recent months. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The internet, education, manufacturing, service and entertainment industries, where young people are concentrated, have been hit hard in recent years, with severe layoffs and declining revenues, and job prospects for young people in the foreseeable future are not looking up. For those who do find jobs, job instability may be high. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> From a statistical perspective, youth unemployment does not seem to be much of a concern. Based on the China Census Yearbook 2020, a macroeconomic research report by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pdf.dfcfw.com/pdf/H301_AP202207251576517991_1.pdf\">Orient Securities</a>&nbsp;states that the share of employed people aged 16-24 in the employed population decreased from 14.3% in 2010 to 7.1% in 2020, due to changes in population age structure; the shift in the overall unemployment rate is only 0.07% for each 1% increase in the youth unemployment rate. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> However, high unemployment among the youth could be of grave political concern for the Communist Party. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Compared with previous generations of Chinese, those born after 1990 belong to the most fortunate generation in recent history: they have a better standard of living than ever before, their families have been willing to invest in them, they have grown up with more freedoms and more education, and they generally are full of optimism for the future. Many of them have studied abroad; the cultural trends they follow are heavily influenced by the West, especially the United States. Now, just as their lives seem ready to take off, the course of history may have turned: the good life they are used to may not be getting better; the period they have grown up in may well be a fleeting aberration rather than a sustainable norm. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Unlike the 1989 generation, today‚Äôs youth have not grown up with a keen interest in politics. But last November, they were the ones who&nbsp;<a href=\"https://chinachange.org/2023/02/18/hutong-dj-bars-youth-and-unexpected-politics-the-detained-blank-paper-protesters-of-beijing/\">took to the streets</a>&nbsp;across major cities to protest the cruel and foolish zero-Covid policy. We do not know the deliberations within the CCP, but following the Blank Paper protests, the CCP may begin to see young people, besieged by unemployment, as a potent destabilizing force and take more forceful measures in response to this problem. It is perfectly in line with the CCP‚Äôs logic of nipping potential threats in the bud and maintaining regime security at all costs. </p><h4>The new ‚Äúsend-down‚Äù plan</h4><p class=\"paragraph\"> On February 20, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League held a ‚Äúmobilization conference for Guangdong youth to aid in high-quality development‚Äù and officially announced a plan to send 300,000 youth to the countryside by the end of 2025, with the tongue-twisting title ‚ÄúThe three-year action plan of Guangdong youth going to the countryside, returning to the countryside, and rejuvenating the countryside to help the project of high-quality development of 100 counties, 1,000 townships, and 10,000 villages.‚Äù There have been&nbsp;<a href=\"http://dara.gd.gov.cn/mtbd5789/content/post_4098581.html\">news release</a>&nbsp;and coverage of this mobilization conference, but it wasn‚Äôt until a few days ago, when someone revealed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/whyyoutouzhele/status/1642848766897053696?s=20\">the full text</a>&nbsp;of the plan on Twitter. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The plan consists of three parts: organizing city youth to go to the countryside; mobilizing rural youth living in the city to return to the countryside; and cultivating youth in the countryside to make them stay in the countryside. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The plan to&nbsp;‚Äúorganize city youth to go the countryside‚Äù&nbsp;has three components: </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> 1) Each year,&nbsp;10,000 graduates&nbsp;from colleges in Guangdong are to be sent to less developed parts of the province for two to three years of ‚Äúvoluntary services‚Äù to provide talents to ‚Äúrural rejuvenation.‚Äù According to the plan, the young volunteers will assume the positions of Communist Youth League cadres, promoters of rural rejuvenation, and liaisons for young people returning home, and service personnel for formerly rural townships recently redesignated as urban areas. And favorable policies will follow to ‚Äúencourage and support volunteers to put their roots down.‚Äù </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> 2) Each year,&nbsp;1,000 teams of volunteers, consisting of vocational school students, are to go to the countryside during the summer to provide technology know-how to rural enterprises, startups, and government‚Äôs key projects and help train locals. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> 2) Each year,&nbsp;1,000 young entrepreneurs&nbsp;from inside and outside the province are to be recruited to participate in the development of townships and villages.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The plan to ‚Äúmobilize rural youth living in the city to return to the countryside‚Äù: Each year,&nbsp;a minimum of 30,000 college graduates&nbsp;will be sent back to where their rural household registrations are. Municipalities and counties will have a system to register local youth who have left for colleges and provide them with internship or job opportunities to incentivize them to return home. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> The plan calls for ‚Äúhelping train 30,000 rural-based youth‚Äù&nbsp;each year to engage in digital commerce, farming, and cooperatives (Âêà‰ΩúÁ§æ), which was a relic of the Mao-era planned economy and is seeing a government-led comeback in rural China. The government will support 3,000 such startup projects each year by providing loans to recent college graduates returning home. </p><p class=\"paragraph\"> Chinese netizens and commentators immediately dubbed this plan ‚Äúthe new educated urban youth being sent down to the countryside‚Äù (Êñ∞Áü•ËØÜÈùíÂπ¥‰∏äÂ±±‰∏ã‰π°). </p>",
