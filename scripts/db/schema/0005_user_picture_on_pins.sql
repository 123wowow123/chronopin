-- Pins show their author's picture, so the view carries "User"."pictureUrl"
-- next to the userName it already joins for. CREATE OR REPLACE can only add
-- columns at the end of the list, which is why it sits after Merchant.
--
-- pictureUrl holds either a full URL (a Facebook or Google photo, copied at
-- social login) or the name of a blob in the thumb container (a picture the
-- user uploaded), which the client prefixes with thumbUrlPrefix like any thumb.
